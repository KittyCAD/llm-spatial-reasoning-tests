# Prompt #1: Imagine a block letter ‘F’. Rotate it 90° clockwise in the plane, then spin it 180° about the vertical axis (like turning a page). Draw the result in ASCII.

## OpenAI o3
Here’s the block you get after the two moves (spaces are empty cells):

```
#####
# #

```

Let me work through this step by step.

Starting with a block letter 'F':
```
████
█
████
█
█
```

Step 1: Rotate 90° clockwise in the plane
- The top of the F moves to the right
- The vertical line becomes horizontal
- The result looks like:
```
█████
    █
    █
```

Step 2: Spin 180° about the vertical axis (like turning a page)
- This flips it left-to-right
- The horizontal lines now point left instead of right
- The result is:
```
█████
█
█
```

So the final ASCII drawing is:
```
█████

```

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step with a standard block 'F'.

1.  **Start with a block letter 'F':**
    Let's imagine a common ASCII representation:
    ```
    #####
    #
    ###  (Middle arm is often shorter)
    #
    #
    ```
    (Height: 5 units, Top arm width: 5 units, Middle arm width: 3 units)

2.  **Rotate it 90° clockwise in the plane:**
    Imagine the 'F' is flat on a table, and you turn it 90° clockwise.
    *   The vertical spine of the 'F' becomes horizontal, forming the new "base".
    *   The horizontal arms of the 'F' become vertical, pointing "upwards" from this new base.
    *   The original top arm will be on one side (let's say the "left" side of the new base after rotation, if thinking of the F's original bottom as the start of the base).
    *   The original middle arm will be further along the base.

    Let's visualize the transformation of our specific F:
    *   The 5-unit high spine becomes a 5-unit wide base: `#####`
    *   The 5-unit wide top arm becomes a 5-unit high prong on the "left" of this base.
    *   The 3-unit wide middle arm becomes a 3-unit high prong, starting from the 3rd position of the base (corresponding to where it connected to the original spine).

    The result (Intermediate Stage) would look like an 'E' missing its bottom arm, lying on its back, with the opening to the left:
    ```
    #        (Corresponds to the tip of the original top arm)
    #
    #   #    (Original top arm, and tip of original middle arm)
    #   #
    #   #    (Base of original top arm, and base of original middle arm)
    #####    (Original spine, now horizontal)
    ```

3.  **Spin it 180° about the vertical axis (like turning a page):**
    This means we take the Intermediate Stage and flip it horizontally, as if reflecting it in a mirror placed vertically.
    *   What was on the left moves to the right.
    *   What was on the right moves to the left.
    *   The center column (if one exists) stays in place.

    Applying this to our Intermediate Stage:
    Original Intermediate:
    ```
    #        (col 1)
    #        (col 1)
    #   #    (col 1, col 5)
    #   #    (col 1, col 5)
    #   #    (col 1, col 5)
    #####    (col 1-5)
    ```
    Flipping horizontally (assuming a 5-character width for the bounding box):
    *   Column 1 swaps with Column 5.
    *   Column 2 swaps with Column 4.
    *   Column 3 stays Column 3.

    The mirrored shape (Final Result):
    ```
        #    (col 5)
        #    (col 5)
    #   #    (col 5, col 1 -> reordered to col 1, col 5)
    #   #    (col 5, col 1 -> reordered to col 1, col 5)
    #   #    (col 5, col 1 -> reordered to col 1, col 5)
    #####    (col 5-1 -> reordered to col 1-5)
    ```

**Final ASCII Drawing:**

```
    #
    #
#   #
#   #
#   #
#####
```

## DeepSeek Reasoner
After rotating the block letter 'F' 90° clockwise and then spinning it 180° about the vertical axis (like turning a page), the resulting ASCII art is shown below. The transformations are applied step-by-step to a simple 5x4 block 'F' for clarity.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Initial Block 'F' (5x4 grid):**
   ```
   ####
   #   
   ### 
   #   
   #   
   ```
   - Top bar: full width (4 characters).
   - Vertical stem: left side, with the middle bar shorter.

2. **After 90° Clockwise Rotation:**
   - The grid becomes 4 rows by 5 columns (since rotation changes dimensions).
   - Result:
     ```
     #####
       # #
       # #
         #
     ```
   - Visually: The top row is fully filled (from the original left stem), and the remaining rows have a pattern from the original horizontal bars and empty spaces.

3. **After 180° Spin About Vertical Axis (like turning a page):**
   - This is equivalent to a horizontal flip (reflection over the vertical axis).
   - Apply to the rotated grid: reverse each row.
   - Final result (4x5 grid):
     ```
     #####
     # #  
     # #  
     #    
     ```

### Final ASCII Drawing:
The result of both transformations is:
```
#####
# #  
# #  
#    
```

- **Description:**
  - Row 1: All 5 positions filled (`#`), forming a solid horizontal bar.
  - Rows 2 and 3: `#` at positions 1 and 3, with spaces elsewhere, creating two vertical segments with a gap.
  - Row 4: `#` only at position 1, with spaces elsewhere, forming a shorter vertical segment.
- This shape no longer resembles an 'F' due to the combined rotations and spin. It might be interpreted as an abstract pattern or a modified flag-like design.

Note: The ASCII art uses `#` for filled blocks and spaces for empty areas. For best viewing, use a monospace font.

## Grok 3
Let's break this down step by step to visualize the transformations and then create an ASCII representation of the final result.

1. **Initial Shape (Block Letter 'F')**:
   A block letter 'F' in ASCII might look like this:
   ```
   *****
   *
   *
   ****
   *
   *
   ```

   This represents the vertical stem and the two horizontal arms of the 'F'.

2. **Step 1: Rotate 90° Clockwise in the Plane**:
   Rotating the 'F' 90° clockwise in the 2D plane means the top of the 'F' moves to the right. The vertical stem becomes horizontal (pointing to the right), and the horizontal arms become vertical (pointing down). After this rotation, the shape might look like this:
   ```
   *
   *
   *****
   ****
   ```

   Here, the original vertical stem is now the bottom horizontal line (`*****`), and the arms are now the vertical lines on the left (`*`s above the bottom line) and the middle horizontal arm (`****`).

3. **Step 2: Spin 180° About the Vertical Axis**:
   Spinning the shape 180° about the vertical axis means flipping it left-to-right, like turning a page or looking at it in a mirror. The left side becomes the right side and vice versa. After this flip, the shape becomes:
   ```
      *
      *
   *****
    ****
   ```

   The vertical lines that were on the left are now on the right, and the horizontal lines are reversed in their left-to-right order.

4. **Final ASCII Representation**:
   Let's refine the ASCII drawing to make it clear and visually balanced. The final shape after both transformations is:
   ```
      *
      *
   *****
    ****
   ```

This represents the block letter 'F' after a 90° clockwise rotation in the plane (turning it so the stem points right and arms point down) and then a 180° spin about the vertical axis (flipping it left-to-right). The result resembles a transformed 'F' with the main stem still horizontal at the bottom but the arms now on the right side pointing upward.
