# Prompt #4: Fold a square sheet along its vertical center line. Punch a hole 1 cm from the top-left corner of the folded sheet. Unfold it—where are the holes relative to the original corners?

## OpenAI o3
Call the side of the square L.  
Place the unfolded sheet on a grid with

• origin at the original top-left corner (0,0)  
• x–axis to the right, y–axis downward.

Fold the sheet about the vertical centre line x = L⁄2.  
Now the folded sheet is L⁄2 wide and its top-left corner is still (0,0) (the original top-left corner).

Punch the hole 1 cm to the right and 1 cm down from that corner, i.e. at (1 cm , 1 cm).  
Because the sheet is doubled, the punch passes through both layers:

Layer that was on the top (the left half) … hole at (1 , 1).

Layer underneath (the right half) … its points are mirror images of the top layer in the line x = L⁄2, so the second hole appears at

 x = L − 1 cm, y = 1 cm.

Unfolding the paper therefore shows

• one hole 1 cm from the top edge and 1 cm from the left edge (top-left corner),  
• a second hole 1 cm from the top edge and 1 cm from the right edge (top-right corner).

So after unfolding there are two holes, each 1 cm down from the top edge: one 1 cm in from the left edge and the other 1 cm in from the right edge.

I need to work through this step-by-step.

Starting with a square sheet:
- When I fold it along the vertical center line, I'm bringing the right half over to meet the left half (or vice versa)
- The sheet is now folded in half vertically

After folding:
- The "top-left corner of the folded sheet" is where the original top-left corner of the square is located
- When I punch a hole 1 cm from this corner, I'm going through both layers of the folded paper

When I unfold the sheet:
- The hole that was punched in the left layer stays in the same position: 1 cm from the top-left corner
- The hole that was punched in the right layer (which was folded over) will now be 1 cm from the top-right corner

So there will be two holes:
1. One hole 1 cm from the top-left corner
2. One hole 1 cm from the top-right corner

Both holes are equidistant from their respective top corners and at the same height from the top edge of the sheet.

Let's visualize this:

1.  **Original Square:**
    Imagine your square sheet. Let's call its corners:
    *   Top-Left (TL)
    *   Top-Right (TR)
    *   Bottom-Left (BL)
    *   Bottom-Right (BR)

2.  **The Fold:**
    You fold it along its vertical center line. This means the right edge (TR-BR) is brought over to meet the left edge (TL-BL).
    The folded sheet is now a rectangle, half the width of the original square, but the same height.
    The "top-left corner of the folded sheet" is the original Top-Left (TL) corner of the square.

3.  **The Punch:**
    You punch a hole 1 cm from the top-left corner of this *folded* sheet.
    *   This means the hole is 1 cm down from the top edge.
    *   And it's 1 cm to the right from the left edge (which is the original left edge of the square).

4.  **Unfolding:**
    When you unfold the sheet, two layers of paper were punched.
    *   **Hole 1:** The hole in the layer that was on the "bottom" of the fold (which was the original left half of the square). Its position is exactly where you punched it relative to the original top-left corner:
        *   1 cm from the original top edge.
        *   1 cm from the original left edge.
        (So, it's 1 cm down and 1 cm in from the original Top-Left corner).

    *   **Hole 2:** The hole in the layer that was on the "top" of the fold (which was the original right half of the square). When unfolded, this hole will be a mirror image of the first hole across the fold line.
        *   It will still be 1 cm from the original top edge (the vertical position doesn't change relative to the top).
        *   Horizontally, since the first hole was 1 cm from the left edge, this second hole will be 1 cm from the original *right* edge.
        (So, it's 1 cm down and 1 cm in from the original Top-Right corner).

**Therefore, after unfolding, there will be two holes:**

1.  **One hole 1 cm from the top edge and 1 cm from the left edge of the original square.**
2.  **A second hole 1 cm from the top edge and 1 cm from the right edge of the original square.**

## DeepSeek Reasoner
When the square sheet is folded along its vertical center line, the top-left corner of the folded sheet corresponds to the midpoint of the top edge of the original square. Let the side length of the square be \(S\) cm, with the top-left corner of the original sheet at coordinates \((0,0)\), top-right at \((S,0)\), bottom-left at \((0,S)\), and bottom-right at \((S,S)\). The vertical center line is at \(x = S/2\).

After folding, the top-left corner of the folded sheet is at \((S/2, 0)\) in the original coordinate system. Punching a hole "1 cm from the top-left corner" of the folded sheet is interpreted as 1 cm to the right and 1 cm down from this point, at \((S/2 + 1, 1)\) in the folded coordinate system. This point is not on the fold line, so punching the hole pierces both layers of the folded sheet.

When unfolded, the hole corresponds to two points on the original sheet due to the folding:
- The point \((S/2 + 1, 1)\) on the folded sheet comes from the original right half at \((S/2 + 1, 1)\) and the original left half at \((S/2 - 1, 1)\), because the left half is mapped to the right during folding.

Thus, after unfolding, there are two holes at:
- \((S/2 - 1, 1)\)
- \((S/2 + 1, 1)\)

**Relative to the original corners:**
- **Top-left corner \((0,0)\):**
  - The hole at \((S/2 - 1, 1)\) is \((S/2 - 1)\) cm to the right and 1 cm down.
  - The hole at \((S/2 + 1, 1)\) is \((S/2 + 1)\) cm to the right and 1 cm down.
- **Top-right corner \((S,0)\):**
  - The hole at \((S/2 - 1, 1)\) is \((S/2 + 1)\) cm to the left and 1 cm down (since \(S - (S/2 - 1) = S/2 + 1\)).
  - The hole at \((S/2 + 1, 1)\) is \((S/2 - 1)\) cm to the left and 1 cm down (since \(S - (S/2 + 1) = S/2 - 1\)).
- **Bottom-left corner \((0,S)\):**
  - The hole at \((S/2 - 1, 1)\) is \((S/2 - 1)\) cm to the right and \((S - 1)\) cm up (since \(S - 1\) cm up from \(y=S\)).
  - The hole at \((S/2 + 1, 1)\) is \((S/2 + 1)\) cm to the right and \((S - 1)\) cm up.
- **Bottom-right corner \((S,S)\):**
  - The hole at \((S/2 - 1, 1)\) is \((S/2 + 1)\) cm to the left and \((S - 1)\) cm up (since \(S - (S/2 - 1) = S/2 + 1\)).
  - The hole at \((S/2 + 1, 1)\) is \((S/2 - 1)\) cm to the left and \((S - 1)\) cm up.

In descriptive terms, the holes are symmetric about the vertical center line (\(x = S/2\)), each 1 cm below the top edge and 1 cm away from the center line horizontally (one 1 cm left and one 1 cm right).

\boxed{\text{After unfolding, there are two holes: one at } \left( \frac{S}{2} - 1, 1 \right) \text{ and one at } \left( \frac{S}{2} + 1, 1 \right) \text{ in the coordinate system where the top-left corner is } (0,0). \text{ Relative to the original corners, the holes are 1 cm below the top edge and symmetrically located at } \frac{S}{2} - 1 \text{ cm and } \frac{S}{2} + 1 \text{ cm from the left edge.}}

## Grok 3
Let's analyze the situation step by step to determine the positions of the holes relative to the original corners of the square sheet after unfolding.

1. **Initial Setup**: Consider a square sheet of paper with side length \( s \) (the exact value of \( s \) isn't critical for determining relative positions). Label the corners of the square as follows:
   - Top-left corner: \( A (0, s) \)
   - Top-right corner: \( B (s, s) \)
   - Bottom-left corner: \( C (0, 0) \)
   - Bottom-right corner: \( D (s, 0) \)
   Here, the coordinate system has the origin at the bottom-left corner \( C \), with the x-axis increasing to the right and the y-axis increasing upwards.

2. **Folding Along the Vertical Center Line**: Folding the square along its vertical center line means folding along the line \( x = s/2 \). This fold brings the left half of the sheet over the right half (or vice versa, but for consistency, assume the left side is folded over the right). After folding:
   - Point \( A (0, s) \) maps to point \( B (s, s) \), because the fold reflects points across the line \( x = s/2 \). The distance from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = s/2 \) is \( s/2 \), so reflecting across \( x = s/2 \) places it at \( x = s/2 + s/2 = s \), same y-coordinate.
   - Point \( C (0, 0) \) maps to point \( D (s, 0) \).
   - The folded sheet now has two layers, with the crease along \( x = s/2 \), and the left side is overlaid on the right side.

3. **Punching a Hole**: The hole is punched 1 cm from the "top-left corner of the folded sheet." After folding, the top-left corner of the folded sheet corresponds to the position where points \( A \) and \( B \) are now together, at coordinates \( (s, s) \), since the left side is folded over to the right. In the folded state, the visible top-left corner of the folded sheet (assuming left over right) is actually at \( (s, s) \), because the left edge has been brought to the right.

   However, we must interpret "top-left corner of the folded sheet" carefully. When the sheet is folded along the vertical center, the folded sheet's dimensions are \( s/2 \) in width and \( s \) in height, with the fold (crease) on the right side if left is folded over right. The "top-left corner" of the folded sheet, in the typical sense of how one views the folded paper, would be the top corner on the left side of the visible folded structure. Since the left side is over the right, the visible left edge is at \( x = s/2 \) to \( x = s \), but we need to clarify:

   - After folding left over right, the folded sheet's left edge is at \( x = s/2 \), and the right edge (the crease) is at \( x = s \).
   - The top-left corner of the folded sheet, as one would naturally describe it, is at \( (s/2, s) \), because that's the top corner on the left side of the visible folded sheet.

   Given the problem's phrasing, "top-left corner of the folded sheet," it is most logical to interpret this as the corner at \( (s/2, s) \), as that is the leftmost top corner in the folded configuration when viewed.

4. **Hole Position in Folded State**: The hole is punched 1 cm from the top-left corner of the folded sheet, which we've identified as \( (s/2, s) \). Since it's a folded sheet with two layers, punching a hole will go through both layers at the same position. Assuming "1 cm from the top-left corner" means 1 cm right and/or down (as corners are reference points), but since it's a corner, likely it's 1 cm along the edges or diagonally. The standard interpretation in such problems is often along the edges unless specified.

   Let's assume the hole is punched 1 cm to the right and 1 cm down from the top-left corner of the folded sheet for simplicity, as "from the corner" often implies a position relative to both axes in paper-folding problems. So, in the folded state:
   - Top-left corner of folded sheet: \( (s/2, s) \)
   - Hole position: 1 cm to the right and 1 cm down, so coordinates \( (s/2 + 1, s - 1) \)

   Since the sheet is folded, this hole at \( (s/2 + 1, s - 1) \) goes through both layers. In the folded state, the left layer (originally \( x = 0 \) to \( s/2 \)) is mapped to the right side. A point at \( (x, y) \) where \( 0 \leq x \leq s/2 \) is folded to \( (s - x, y) \).

   - In the folded state, the hole punched at \( (s/2 + 1, s - 1) \) is on the right side of the crease (since \( s/2 + 1 > s/2 \)), so it corresponds to a point on the original right half of the sheet, and also, since it's through both layers, to the corresponding point on the left half that was folded over.

   Specifically:
   - The hole at \( (s/2 + 1, s - 1) \) is on the top layer (originally the left side folded over). The original point before folding that maps to \( (s/2 + 1, s - 1) \) is at \( x = s - (s/2 + 1) = s/2 - 1 \), y-coordinate remains \( s - 1 \). So, original point on left side: \( (s/2 - 1, s - 1) \).
   - The same hole punches through to the bottom layer (original right side) at \( (s/2 + 1, s - 1) \).

5. **Unfolding the Sheet**: When the sheet is unfolded, the holes remain at their original positions relative to the sheet's material points:
   - One hole at \( (s/2 - 1, s - 1) \), which is on the left half.
   - One hole at \( (s/2 + 1, s - 1) \), which is on the right half.

6. **Relative to Original Corners**: Now, let's describe the positions of these holes relative to the original corners of the square:
   - Original top-left corner \( A (0, s) \):
     - Hole at \( (s/2 - 1, s - 1) \): This is \( s/2 - 1 \) cm to the right and 1 cm down from \( A \).
   - Original top-right corner \( B (s, s) \):
     - Hole at \( (s/2 + 1, s - 1) \): This is \( s - (s/2 + 1) = s/2 - 1 \) cm to the left and 1 cm down from \( B \).

   Since the square's side length \( s \) is not specified, but the holes are symmetrically placed due to the fold, we can summarize:
   - There is one hole 1 cm below the top edge and 1 cm to the right of the vertical center line (at \( x = s/2 + 1 \)), which is closer to the top-right corner.
   - There is another hole 1 cm below the top edge and 1 cm to the left of the vertical center line (at \( x = s/2 - 1 \)), which is closer to the top-left corner.

   More precisely:
   - Relative to top-left corner \( A (0, s) \), the nearest hole is at \( (s/2 - 1, s - 1) \), which is approximately halfway across the top edge (shifted left of center by 1 cm) and 1 cm down.
   - Relative to top-right corner \( B (s, s) \), the nearest hole is at \( (s/2 + 1, s - 1) \), which is approximately halfway across the top edge (shifted right of center by 1 cm) and 1 cm down.

To make it clearer, since \( s \) is unknown but presumably much larger than 1 cm, the holes are near the top edge, symmetrically placed about the vertical center line:
- One hole is 1 cm down from the top and 1 cm right of the center line.
- The other hole is 1 cm down from the top and 1 cm left of the center line.

Thus, relative to the original corners:
- There is a hole near the top-left corner, specifically \( s/2 - 1 \) cm right and 1 cm down from it.
- There is a hole near the top-right corner, specifically \( s/2 - 1 \) cm left and 1 cm down from it.

**Final Answer**: After unfolding, there are two holes in the sheet. One hole is located 1 cm below the top edge and 1 cm to the right of the vertical center line, closer to the top-right corner. The other hole is located 1 cm below the top edge and 1 cm to the left of the vertical center line, closer to the top-left corner.
