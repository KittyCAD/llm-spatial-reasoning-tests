# Prompt #6: A circular robot with radius 0.4 m must move from (0,0) to (6,0). There’s a 1 m-wide corridor whose centerline is the polyline (0,0)→(3,2)→(6,0). Can the robot stay inside the corridor the whole way?

## OpenAI o3
Yes – it can.

Why?

1.  What “1 m-wide corridor” means  
    The set of points that belong to the corridor is  
      C = { p : distance (p , centre-line) ≤ 0.50 m }  

    i.e. at every point of the poly-line you may step 0.50 m to either side and still
    remain inside the corridor.

2.  What the robot needs  
    The robot is a disc of radius R = 0.40 m.  
    In order for the whole robot to be inside C, its centre has to stay in the
    set  

        C ⊖ D(R) = { p : distance (p , centre-line) ≤ (0.50 − R) }        (1)

    (‛⊖’ is the Minkowski subtraction; geometrically we just move the corridor
    boundaries R metres inwards.)

3.  Shrinking the corridor for the robot’s centre  
    With R = 0.40 m, the half-width that remains in (1) is

        0.50 m − 0.40 m = 0.10 m .

    So the centre of the robot merely has to stay within
    ±0.10 m of the original centre-line (more precisely, within that 0.20 m-wide
    “inner corridor”).

4.  Does that inner corridor exist all the way round the bend?  
    At every vertex of the poly-line the original corridor already contains a
    full disc of radius 0.50 m (that is what the definition in step 1 implies).
    After shrinking it by 0.40 m we still have a disc of radius

        0.50 − 0.40 = 0.10 m ,

    so the inner corridor is continuous through the corner at (3, 2); it does not
    pinch off or disappear.

5.  A feasible path  
    One admissible path for the robot’s centre is simply the original
    poly-line (0, 0) → (3, 2) → (6, 0); every point of that poly-line is
    certainly within 0.10 m of itself, hence inside the inner corridor (1).
    Following that path keeps the whole disc-shaped robot inside the
    1 m-wide corridor for the entire motion.

Because the robot’s radius (0.40 m) is smaller than the corridor half-width
(0.50 m), and the reduced corridor for its centre is continuous from start to
finish, the robot can indeed travel from (0, 0) to (6, 0) without ever leaving
the corridor.

## Claude 4 Sonnet
I need to determine if a circular robot with radius 0.4 m can travel from (0,0) to (6,0) while staying entirely within a 1 m-wide corridor.

First, let me understand the corridor geometry:
- The corridor has a centerline that goes from (0,0) to (3,2) to (6,0)
- The corridor is 1 m wide, so it extends 0.5 m on each side of the centerline

The robot has radius 0.4 m, so its center must stay at least 0.4 m away from the corridor walls. This means the robot's center must stay within a "safe zone" that is 0.5 - 0.4 = 0.1 m from the centerline.

Now I'll analyze the critical point - the corner at (3,2):

At the corner, the corridor makes a sharp turn. Let me calculate the angle:
- Vector from (0,0) to (3,2): (3,2)
- Vector from (3,2) to (6,0): (3,-2)

The angle between these vectors can be found using the dot product:
- cos(θ) = [(3)(3) + (2)(-2)] / [√(9+4) × √(9+4)] = 5/13

This gives θ = arccos(5/13) ≈ 67.4°

The turn angle at the corner is 180° - 67.4° = 112.6°

At a sharp corner like this, the effective corridor width for the robot's center is reduced. The robot must navigate around the inside corner while keeping its entire body within the corridor.

At the corner point (3,2), the corridor walls meet at an angle. The robot's center cannot get arbitrarily close to the corner point because part of the robot would extend outside the corridor.

To find if the robot can pass: The minimum distance from the corner point to the robot's center occurs when the robot is tangent to both corridor walls at the corner. Given the geometry and the turn angle of 112.6°, the robot's center must maintain a certain minimum distance from the corner vertex.

For a turn angle of 112.6°, the minimum distance from the corner to the robot center is:
d = 0.4 / sin(112.6°/2) = 0.4 / sin(56.3°) ≈ 0.48 m

Since the corridor is only 0.5 m wide on each side, the safe zone for the robot's center is only 0.1 m from the centerline. But the robot needs to stay at least 0.48 m from the corner point, which is more than the 0.1 m available.

Therefore, **the robot cannot stay inside the corridor the whole way**. The sharp turn at (3,2) creates a bottleneck where the robot cannot fit while remaining entirely within the corridor boundaries.

## Gemini Pro
Let R be the radius of the robot, R = 0.4 m.
Let W be the width of the corridor, W = 1 m. The half-width of the corridor is H = W/2 = 0.5 m.
The centerline of the corridor is a polyline P1P2P3, where P1=(0,0), P2=(3,2), and P3=(6,0).

Let C denote the centerline of the corridor. The corridor G itself is the set of all points p such that the minimum distance from p to C is less than or equal to H. That is, G = {p | dist(p, C) <= H}.

The robot is a circular disk. Let its center be c_R. The set of points occupied by the robot is D(c_R, R) = {p | ||p - c_R|| <= R}.
For the robot to stay inside the corridor, the disk D(c_R, R) must be a subset of G for its entire path.
This condition is equivalent to restricting the robot's center c_R to a smaller region G_R.
The region G_R for the center of the robot is defined as G_R = {q | dist(q, C) <= H - R}.
If H - R < 0, the robot cannot stay in the corridor, as G_R would be empty.
In this case, H - R = 0.5 m - 0.4 m = 0.1 m.
Since H - R = 0.1 m > 0, the region G_R is well-defined.

The problem asks if the robot *can* stay inside the corridor the whole way from (0,0) to (6,0). This means we need to determine if there exists a continuous path for the robot's center, c_R(t), from P1=(0,0) to P3=(6,0), such that c_R(t) remains in G_R for all t along the path.

Consider the centerline C itself as a candidate path for the robot's center.
Let c_R(t) be a point on C.
For any point p on C, the distance from p to C is dist(p, C) = 0.
Since H - R = 0.1 m, any point p on C satisfies dist(p, C) = 0 <= 0.1 m.
Therefore, all points on the centerline C belong to the region G_R.

This means that if the robot's center follows the centerline C = P1P2P3, its center stays within the allowed region G_R.
The path for the robot's center starts at P1=(0,0) and ends at P3=(6,0). Both P1 and P3 are on C, and therefore in G_R. The entire polyline P1P2P3 lies in G_R.

This configuration is valid provided that the robot, being a physical object, can actually follow the path P1P2P3. A circular robot has no preferred orientation. It can change its direction of motion without changing its occupied space. If necessary, it can stop at P2, pivot, and then continue along P2P3. Its center would trace the path P1P2P3.

Let's verify this using the definition of the robot staying in the corridor G.
If the robot's center c_R is on the centerline C, then any point p in the robot disk D(c_R, R) is at a distance ||p - c_R|| <= R from c_R.
By the triangle inequality, the distance from p to C is dist(p, C) <= ||p - c_R|| + dist(c_R, C).
Since c_R is on C, dist(c_R, C) = 0.
So, dist(p, C) <= ||p - c_R|| <= R.
For the robot to be in the corridor G, all points p in D(c_R, R) must satisfy dist(p, C) <= H.
So, if R <= H, then by having its center on C, the robot stays in the corridor.
In this problem, R = 0.4 m and H = 0.5 m. Since 0.4 m <= 0.5 m, the condition is satisfied.

This argument holds for all points along C, including the vertex P2=(3,2). When the robot's center is at P2, every point p of the robot satisfies dist(p, P2) <= R. Since P2 is on C, dist(p,C) <= dist(p,P2) <= R. As R <= H, all points p are within G. The robot does not "hit" any wall of the corridor.

The "inner corner" of the corridor at the turn P2 might seem like a point of concern.
The centerline vectors are V1 = P2-P1 = (3,2) and V2 = P3-P2 = (3,-2).
The angle theta between V1 and V2 is given by cos(theta) = (V1 . V2) / (||V1|| ||V2||) = (3*3 + 2*(-2)) / (sqrt(3^2+2^2) * sqrt(3^2+(-2)^2)) = (9-4) / (sqrt(13)*sqrt(13)) = 5/13.
Since cos(theta) > 0, the angle is acute (approx 67.38 degrees). This is the angle P1-P2-P3.
The corridor boundary on the "inside" of this turn (the side towards x < 3 for y=2, or generally, the side where the polyline "turns towards") is formed by a circular arc centered at P2 with radius H = W/2 = 0.5 m.
Any point p on this arc has dist(p, P2) = H.
When the robot's center is at P2, all points of the robot are within distance R = 0.4 m from P2.
Since R < H (0.4m < 0.5m), the robot disk D(P2, R) is strictly contained within the disk B(P2, H).
The points in B(P2,H) are generally in G. Specifically, points p for which P2 is the closest point on C satisfy dist(p,C)=dist(p,P2). Thus if dist(p,P2) <= H, then p is in G. All points in D(P2,R) satisfy dist(p,P2) <= R < H, so they are all in G.

So, the robot can move its center along the path (0,0)->(3,2)->(6,0). At every point on this path (including the corner P2), the robot (a disk of radius 0.4m) remains entirely within the 1m-wide corridor.

Conclusion: Yes, the robot can stay inside the corridor the whole way.

The final answer is $\boxed{Yes}$.

## DeepSeek Reasoner
The robot has a radius of 0.4 m, and the corridor is 1 m wide, meaning there is 0.5 m of space on each side of the centerline. For the robot to stay within the corridor, its center must remain within a perpendicular distance of \(0.5 - 0.4 = 0.1\) m from the centerline polyline, as this ensures the robot does not intersect the corridor boundaries.

The centerline polyline is defined by the segments from (0,0) to (3,2) and from (3,2) to (6,0). The region within 0.1 m perpendicular distance of this polyline is connected because the internal angle at the vertex (3,2) is approximately 112.62°, which is less than 180°. This angle is calculated as follows:
- Vector from (0,0) to (3,2): \(\mathbf{V_1} = (3, 2)\)
- Vector from (3,2) to (6,0): \(\mathbf{V_2} = (3, -2)\)
- Dot product: \(\mathbf{V_1} \cdot \mathbf{V_2} = 3 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot (-2) = 9 - 4 = 5\)
- Magnitudes: \(|\mathbf{V_1}| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{13}\), \(|\mathbf{V_2}| = \sqrt{3^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{13}\)
- Cosine of the angle \(\phi\) between vectors: \(\cos \phi = \frac{5}{13} \approx 0.3846\), so \(\phi \approx \arccos(0.3846) \approx 67.38^\circ\)
- Internal angle at (3,2): \(180^\circ - 67.38^\circ = 112.62^\circ\)

Since the internal angle is less than 180°, the region within 0.1 m of the polyline includes a disk of radius 0.1 m centered at (3,2), which connects the offset regions along the two segments. Therefore, a continuous path exists for the robot's center from (0,0) to (6,0) that stays within 0.1 m of the centerline. Specifically, the robot's center can follow the centerline polyline directly:
- From (0,0) to (3,2) along the first segment.
- Then from (3,2) to (6,0) along the second segment.

At (3,2), the center is on the vertex, with perpendicular distance 0 to the centerline, which is within the 0.1 m requirement. Along the segments, the perpendicular distance is 0, also within 0.1 m.

Additionally, the clearance from the corridor boundaries is sufficient:
- At (3,2), the inner corner of the corridor is at approximately (3, 1.399), calculated from the intersection of the inner offset lines at 0.5 m from the centerline.
- Distance from (3,2) to (3,1.399) is \(2 - 1.399 = 0.601\) m.
- With the robot center at (3,2), the distance to the inner corner is 0.601 m, so the robot's boundary is \(0.601 - 0.4 = 0.201\) m from the inner corner.
- Even at a point like (3,1.9), which is within 0.1 m of the centerline (distance to (3,2) is 0.1 m), the distance to the inner corner is \(1.9 - 1.399 = 0.501\) m, so the robot's boundary is \(0.501 - 0.4 = 0.101\) m from the inner corner, which is positive.

Thus, the robot can stay inside the corridor throughout its movement.

\boxed{\text{yes}}

## Grok 3
To determine whether the circular robot with a radius of 0.4 m can stay inside the 1 m-wide corridor while moving from (0,0) to (6,0), we need to analyze the geometry of the corridor and the robot's size. The corridor's centerline is a polyline defined by the points (0,0) → (3,2) → (6,0), and the corridor extends 0.5 m on either side of this centerline (since it's 1 m wide). The robot must fit within this corridor at all times, meaning its center must stay within a region that ensures the robot's entire body (a circle of radius 0.4 m) remains inside the corridor.

### Step 1: Understand the Corridor Geometry
The corridor is defined by its centerline, which consists of two line segments:
- Segment 1: From (0,0) to (3,2)
- Segment 2: From (3,2) to (6,0)

Since the corridor is 1 m wide, it forms a strip of width 1 m centered on the polyline. Geometrically, this can be thought of as:
- Two parallel lines offset by 0.5 m on either side of each segment.
- At the corner (3,2), where the two segments meet, the corridor forms a mitered or rounded corner, but for simplicity, we can consider the feasible region for the robot's center by accounting for the robot's radius.

### Step 2: Feasible Path for the Robot's Center
Since the robot has a radius of 0.4 m, its center must stay at least 0.4 m away from the corridor's boundaries to ensure the robot doesn't extend outside the corridor. The corridor's width is 1 m, so the distance from the centerline to the boundary is 0.5 m. Therefore, the robot's center must stay within a region that is inset from the corridor boundaries by 0.4 m. However, a simpler way to think about this is that the effective "corridor" for the robot's center is reduced by the robot's radius on both sides.

- Corridor width = 1 m (0.5 m on each side of the centerline).
- Robot radius = 0.4 m.
- The robot's center must be at least 0.4 m away from the corridor's boundaries to keep the robot fully inside.
- Since the corridor boundary is 0.5 m from the centerline, the robot's center can be at most 0.5 m - 0.4 m = 0.1 m away from the centerline on either side.

Thus, the robot's center must stay within a strip of width 0.2 m (0.1 m on each side of the centerline) along the polyline.

### Step 3: Check the Straight Segments
Along the straight segments of the polyline, the corridor is a straight strip of width 1 m. Since the robot's radius is 0.4 m, and the corridor width is 1 m, the robot's center can move along the centerline or deviate up to 0.1 m on either side, as calculated. This is feasible because:
- Segment 1: From (0,0) to (3,2), the corridor is straight, and the robot's center can follow a path parallel to the centerline within 0.1 m.
- Segment 2: From (3,2) to (6,0), the same applies.

So, along the straight parts, the robot can stay inside the corridor.

### Step 4: Check the Corner at (3,2)
The critical point is at the corner (3,2), where the two segments meet, and the corridor changes direction. The corridor forms a sharp corner, and we need to ensure the robot can navigate this turn without any part of it exiting the corridor.

The two segments meeting at (3,2) have different slopes:
- Segment 1 (from (0,0) to (3,2)): Slope = (2-0)/(3-0) = 2/3.
- Segment 2 (from (3,2) to (6,0)): Slope = (0-2)/(6-3) = -2/3.

The angle between the two segments can be calculated using the dot product of their direction vectors:
- Direction vector of Segment 1: (3,2)
- Direction vector of Segment 2: (3,-2)
- Dot product = (3)(3) + (2)(-2) = 9 - 4 = 5
- Magnitudes: |Segment 1| = sqrt(3² + 2²) = sqrt(13), |Segment 2| = sqrt(3² + (-2)²) = sqrt(13)
- Cosine of angle θ = (dot product)/(|v1||v2|) = 5/(sqrt(13)*sqrt(13)) = 5/13 ≈ 0.3846
- Angle θ = arccos(5/13) ≈ 67.38 degrees

The interior angle of the corridor at (3,2) is 180° - θ ≈ 112.62 degrees (the obtuse angle on the inside of the turn).

At the corner, the corridor's shape depends on how the 1 m width is interpreted at the bend. Typically, for a polyline corridor, the width is maintained perpendicular to the centerline, and at the corner, the feasible region for the robot's center narrows due to the turn.

### Step 5: Feasible Region for Robot's Center at the Corner
To rigorously check if the robot can navigate the corner, we consider the feasible region for the robot's center. The robot's center must be at least 0.4 m away from the corridor's boundaries. At the corner, the corridor's boundaries form a V-shape, and the feasible region for the center is the intersection of the two strips (from each segment) minus the robot's radius.

Since the corridor width (1 m) is greater than twice the robot's radius (2*0.4 m = 0.8 m), there should be some feasible space for the robot's center to pass through the corner. Specifically:
- Corridor half-width = 0.5 m
- Robot radius = 0.4 m
- Effective clearance = 0.5 m - 0.4 m = 0.1 m on each side

Even at the corner, the robot's center can stay within 0.1 m of the centerline on the inside of the turn. We can visualize the feasible path as the robot's center following a smoothed path around the corner, staying within the narrowed feasible region.

### Step 6: Conclusion
Since the corridor width (1 m) is greater than twice the robot's radius (0.8 m), there is enough clearance for the robot to navigate both the straight segments and the corner at (3,2). The robot's center can follow a path that stays within 0.1 m of the centerline on either side, allowing it to move from (0,0) to (6,0) while remaining entirely within the corridor.

**Final Answer**: Yes, the robot can stay inside the corridor the whole way.
