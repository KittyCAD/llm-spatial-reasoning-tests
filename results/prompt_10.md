# Prompt #10: Object A is 15 cm away in X and 8 in away in Y. Object B is 120 mm away in X and 0.1 m in Y. Which is closer?

## OpenAI o3
First put everything in the same unit (metres work well).

Object A  
  X-offset: 15 cm = 0.15 m  
  Y-offset: 8 in = 8 × 0.0254 m = 0.2032 m  
  Distance from the origin:  
        d₁ = √[(0.15)² + (0.2032)²]  
            = √(0.0225 + 0.04129)  
            ≈ 0.2526 m

Object B  
  X-offset: 120 mm = 0.120 m  
  Y-offset: 0.1 m  
  Distance from the origin:  
        d₂ = √[(0.120)² + (0.100)²]  
            = √(0.0144 + 0.0100)  
            ≈ 0.1562 m

Because 0.156 m < 0.253 m, Object B is closer.

## Claude 4 Sonnet
I need to find the straight-line distance from the origin to each object and compare them.

First, let me convert all measurements to the same unit (cm):

Object A:
- X = 15 cm
- Y = 8 in = 8 × 2.54 cm = 20.32 cm

Object B:
- X = 120 mm = 12 cm
- Y = 0.1 m = 10 cm

Now I'll calculate the distance using the Pythagorean theorem (d = √(x² + y²)):

Object A distance:
d_A = √(15² + 20.32²)
d_A = √(225 + 412.90)
d_A = √637.90
d_A ≈ 25.26 cm

Object B distance:
d_B = √(12² + 10²)
d_B = √(144 + 100)
d_B = √244
d_B ≈ 15.62 cm

**Object B is closer** at approximately 15.62 cm away, compared to Object A at approximately 25.26 cm away.

Let's convert all measurements to a single unit, like centimeters (cm), to compare them.

**Conversion Factors:**
*   1 inch = 2.54 cm
*   10 mm = 1 cm (so 1 mm = 0.1 cm)
*   1 m = 100 cm

**Object A:**
*   X-coordinate: 15 cm
*   Y-coordinate: 8 inches = 8 * 2.54 cm = 20.32 cm

**Object B:**
*   X-coordinate: 120 mm = 120 * 0.1 cm = 12 cm
*   Y-coordinate: 0.1 m = 0.1 * 100 cm = 10 cm

Now we calculate the straight-line distance (d) from the origin (0,0) for each object using the distance formula: d = √(x² + y²)

**Distance for Object A (d_A):**
d_A = √(15² + 20.32²)
d_A = √(225 + 412.9024)
d_A = √637.9024
d_A ≈ 25.257 cm

**Distance for Object B (d_B):**
d_B = √(12² + 10²)
d_B = √(144 + 100)
d_B = √244
d_B ≈ 15.620 cm

Comparing the distances:
d_A ≈ 25.257 cm
d_B ≈ 15.620 cm

Since 15.620 cm < 25.257 cm, Object B is closer.

**Answer:** Object B is closer.

## DeepSeek Reasoner
To determine which object is closer, the Euclidean distance from the origin (0,0) to each object must be calculated, as the distances are given along perpendicular X and Y axes. The units need to be consistent for comparison, so all distances are converted to centimeters (cm).

### Conversions:
- 1 cm = 1 cm (no conversion needed)
- 1 inch (in) = 2.54 cm
- 1 millimeter (mm) = 0.1 cm
- 1 meter (m) = 100 cm

**Object A:**
- X: 15 cm
- Y: 8 in = 8 × 2.54 cm = 20.32 cm  
Distance: \( d_A = \sqrt{(15)^2 + (20.32)^2} = \sqrt{225 + 412.9024} = \sqrt{637.9024} \approx 25.26 \) cm

**Object B:**
- X: 120 mm = 120 × 0.1 cm = 12 cm
- Y: 0.1 m = 0.1 × 100 cm = 10 cm  
Distance: \( d_B = \sqrt{(12)^2 + (10)^2} = \sqrt{144 + 100} = \sqrt{244} \approx 15.62 \) cm

### Comparison:
- \( d_A \approx 25.26 \) cm
- \( d_B \approx 15.62 \) cm

Since \( 15.62 < 25.26 \), Object B is closer.

Alternatively, comparing the squares of the distances to avoid square roots:
- \( d_A^2 = 637.9024 \)
- \( d_B^2 = 244 \)
- \( 244 < 637.9024 \), confirming that \( d_B < d_A \).

Thus, Object B is closer.

\boxed{\text{Object B}}

## Grok 3
To determine which object is closer, we need to calculate the straight-line (Euclidean) distance of each object from the origin (0,0) using their X and Y coordinates. The formula for the distance is:

Distance = √(X² + Y²)

First, let's ensure all measurements are in the same unit. We'll convert everything to centimeters (cm) since it's a common unit in this context (1 m = 100 cm, 1 mm = 0.1 cm).

### For Object A:
- X = 15 cm
- Y = 8 cm

Distance A = √(15² + 8²)  
           = √(225 + 64)  
           = √289  
           = 17 cm

### For Object B:
- X = 120 mm = 120 * 0.1 = 12 cm
- Y = 0.1 m = 0.1 * 100 = 10 cm

Distance B = √(12² + 10²)  
           = √(144 + 100)  
           = √244  
           ≈ 15.62 cm

### Comparison:
- Distance A = 17 cm
- Distance B ≈ 15.62 cm

Since 15.62 cm is less than 17 cm, **Object B is closer** to the origin.
