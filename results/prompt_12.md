# Prompt #12: You stand at (0,0,0) facing +Y. A mirror is the plane X = 3. Where will your reflection appear?

## OpenAI o3
A flat mirror puts the “virtual” image the same perpendicular distance behind the mirror as the object is in front of it.  
The mirror is the plane  

 X = 3.

Reflect a point (x, y, z) in that plane:

 x′ = 2·3 – x = 6 – x  
 y′ = y  
 z′ = z.

For you, standing at (0, 0, 0):

 x′ = 6 – 0 = 6  
 y′ = 0  
 z′ = 0.

So your reflection is at

 (6, 0, 0).

(The image faces the same +Y direction you do, but with left- and right-handedness reversed.)

I need to find where my reflection appears when I'm standing at the origin facing +Y, with a mirror at the plane X = 3.

To find a reflection in a plane mirror, I need to:
1. Find the perpendicular distance from my position to the mirror
2. The reflection appears at the same distance on the opposite side of the mirror

My position: (0, 0, 0)
Mirror plane: X = 3

The perpendicular distance from my position to the mirror is simply the x-coordinate difference:
Distance = 3 - 0 = 3 units

Since the mirror is at X = 3, and I'm at X = 0, my reflection will appear 3 units on the other side of the mirror.

Reflection position: X = 3 + 3 = 6

The Y and Z coordinates remain unchanged in the reflection, so my reflection appears at:
**(6, 0, 0)**

Note: The fact that I'm facing +Y doesn't change where my reflection appears - it would only affect which direction my reflection appears to be facing (which would be +Y as well, since the mirror doesn't flip the Y direction).

## Gemini Pro
Okay, let's break this down:

1.  **Your position:** (0, 0, 0)
2.  **Mirror plane:** X = 3

The reflection occurs perpendicular to the mirror plane. Since the mirror is defined by X = 3 (a plane parallel to the YZ plane), the reflection will only affect the X-coordinate. The Y and Z coordinates will remain the same.

*   **Your X-coordinate:** 0
*   **Mirror's X-coordinate:** 3
*   **Distance from you to the mirror (along X-axis):** 3 - 0 = 3 units.

Your reflection will be the same distance *on the other side* of the mirror.

*   **Reflection's X-coordinate:** Mirror's X-coordinate + distance = 3 + 3 = 6.
*   **Your Y-coordinate:** 0, so reflection's Y-coordinate is 0.
*   **Your Z-coordinate:** 0, so reflection's Z-coordinate is 0.

Therefore, your reflection will appear at **(6, 0, 0)**.

The fact that you are facing +Y is irrelevant for *where* your reflection appears, though it would be relevant if you were asked what you *see*.

## DeepSeek Reasoner
The mirror is the plane \(X = 3\). The position of the observer is at \((0, 0, 0)\). For a plane mirror, the virtual image of a point is located such that the mirror plane is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining the point and its image.

Given the observer at \((0, 0, 0)\) and the mirror at \(X = 3\), the distance from the observer to the mirror is 3 units in the positive X-direction. Therefore, the image is located 3 units on the opposite side of the mirror, resulting in the coordinates \((6, 0, 0)\).

The facing direction (facing \(+Y\)) does not affect the location of the virtual image, only the direction in which the observer must look to see the reflection. Thus, the reflection will appear at the point \((6, 0, 0)\).

\boxed{(6,0,0)}

## Grok 3
To determine where your reflection appears in the mirror, let's break this down step by step using the principles of reflection and coordinate geometry. You are standing at the point (0, 0, 0), facing the positive Y-direction, and the mirror is the plane X = 3.

### Step 1: Understanding Reflection in a Plane
When you look into a mirror, your reflection appears as if it is behind the mirror at a distance equal to the distance between you and the mirror. Mathematically, for a mirror lying on a plane, the reflection of a point across that plane can be calculated by finding the point on the opposite side of the plane, equidistant from it.

The mirror is the plane X = 3, which is a vertical plane parallel to the YZ-plane. For a point (x, y, z), its reflection across the plane X = 3 will have the same Y and Z coordinates, but the X-coordinate will be adjusted such that the plane X = 3 is the midpoint between the original point and its reflection.

### Step 2: Calculate the Reflection
You are at (0, 0, 0). The mirror plane X = 3 lies 3 units away from you along the X-axis (since 3 - 0 = 3). The reflection of your position across the plane X = 3 will be at a point where the plane is the midpoint between you and your reflection along the X-axis.

- The X-coordinate of the mirror plane is 3.
- The distance from your X-coordinate (0) to the mirror (3) is 3 units.
- Therefore, your reflection will be 3 units on the other side of the mirror, at X = 3 + 3 = 6.

Since the mirror is parallel to the YZ-plane, the Y and Z coordinates of your reflection remain the same as your original position (0 for both).

Thus, the coordinates of your reflection are (6, 0, 0).

### Step 3: Interpretation
Your reflection appears at (6, 0, 0), which is directly behind the mirror, 3 units beyond it along the X-axis, at the same height and lateral position as you.

### Final Answer:
Your reflection will appear at (6, 0, 0).
