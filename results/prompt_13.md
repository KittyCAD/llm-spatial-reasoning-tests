# Prompt #13: A point starts at +7 cm. It slides −18 cm along the line. Where does it end up, and is it left or right of the origin?

## OpenAI o3
Starting position: +7 cm  
Displacement: −18 cm  

Final position = 7 cm + (−18 cm) = −11 cm.

The point ends up at −11 cm, i.e., 11 cm to the left of the origin.

I need to find where the point ends up after sliding from its starting position.

Given information:
- Starting position: +7 cm
- Slides: -18 cm (negative means sliding to the left)

To find the ending position:
Ending position = Starting position + Slide distance
Ending position = 7 + (-18)
Ending position = 7 - 18
Ending position = -11 cm

The point ends up at -11 cm.

Since the position is negative (-11 cm), the point is to the left of the origin (0).

Therefore: The point ends up at -11 cm, which is 11 cm to the left of the origin.

## Gemini Pro
Let's break this down:

1.  **Starting position:** +7 cm
2.  **Movement:** -18 cm (the negative sign means it moves to the left)

To find where it ends up, we add the movement to the starting position:
Final position = Starting position + Movement
Final position = (+7 cm) + (-18 cm)
Final position = 7 - 18 cm
Final position = **-11 cm**

Now, to determine if it's left or right of the origin (0 cm):
Since -11 cm is a negative number, it is to the **left** of the origin.

So, the point ends up at **-11 cm**, and it is **left** of the origin.

## DeepSeek Reasoner
The point starts at +7 cm, which is 7 cm to the right of the origin. Sliding −18 cm means moving 18 cm to the left, as the negative sign indicates the left direction on the number line.

To find the ending position, add the displacement to the starting position:  
+7 cm + (−18 cm) = 7 cm − 18 cm = −11 cm.

The position −11 cm is negative, which means it is to the left of the origin.

Thus, the point ends up at −11 cm, left of the origin.

\boxed{-11} \text{ cm, left of the origin}

## Grok 3
Let's solve this step by step.

1. The point starts at +7 cm, which means it is 7 cm to the right of the origin (0 cm) on a number line.
2. It then slides −18 cm, which means it moves 18 cm to the left (since the negative sign indicates movement in the negative direction).
3. To find the final position, we add the movement to the starting position:  
   \( 7 + (-18) = 7 - 18 = -11 \).
4. The point ends up at −11 cm.

Now, to determine if it is left or right of the origin:
- The origin is at 0 cm.
- Since −11 cm is less than 0, it is to the left of the origin.

**Final Answer:** The point ends up at −11 cm, and it is to the left of the origin.
