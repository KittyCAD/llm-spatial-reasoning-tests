# Prompt #14: Segment A spans [−3 m, +9 m]. Segment B spans [+4 m, +15 m]. What portion (in meters and as a percent of A) do they overlap?

## OpenAI o3
The two intervals overlap where both are simultaneously “on”:

Lower limit of overlap  =  max(−3, 4)  =  4 m  
Upper limit of overlap  =  min(9, 15)   =  9 m  

Overlap interval: [4 m, 9 m]

Length of overlap  
= 9 m − 4 m  
= 5 m

Length of Segment A  
= 9 m − (−3 m)  
= 12 m

Percentage of Segment A that is overlapped  
= (5 m / 12 m) × 100 %  
≈ 41.7 %

So the segments overlap for 5 meters, which is about 41.7 % of Segment A.

I need to find the overlap between segments A and B.

Given information:
- Segment A: [-3 m, +9 m]
- Segment B: [+4 m, +15 m]

First, I'll find the overlap region.

The overlap occurs where both segments exist simultaneously. This is the intersection of the two intervals.

For an overlap to exist:
- The start of the overlap = max(start of A, start of B) = max(-3, 4) = 4 m
- The end of the overlap = min(end of A, end of B) = min(9, 15) = 9 m

So the overlap region is [4 m, 9 m].

The length of the overlap:
Length of overlap = 9 - 4 = 5 m

Now I'll calculate what portion of segment A this represents:
- Length of segment A = 9 - (-3) = 12 m
- Percentage of A = (5 m / 12 m) × 100% = 41.67%

Therefore:
- The overlap is **5 meters**
- This represents **41.67%** of segment A

Let's break this down:

1.  **Define the segments:**
    *   Segment A: [−3 m, +9 m]
    *   Segment B: [+4 m, +15 m]

2.  **Calculate the length of Segment A:**
    Length of A = End_A - Start_A = 9 m - (-3 m) = 9 m + 3 m = 12 m

3.  **Find the overlap region:**
    *   The overlap starts at the *maximum* of the two starting points: max(-3 m, +4 m) = +4 m.
    *   The overlap ends at the *minimum* of the two ending points: min(+9 m, +15 m) = +9 m.
    So, the overlap spans [+4 m, +9 m].

4.  **Calculate the length of the overlap:**
    Length of overlap = End_overlap - Start_overlap = 9 m - 4 m = 5 m.

5.  **Calculate the overlap as a percentage of Segment A:**
    Percentage = (Length of overlap / Length of A) * 100%
    Percentage = (5 m / 12 m) * 100%
    Percentage = (5/12) * 100%
    Percentage ≈ 0.41666... * 100%
    Percentage ≈ 41.67%

**Answer:**
The segments overlap by **5 meters**.
This overlap represents **41.67%** of Segment A.

## DeepSeek Reasoner
Segment A spans from -3 m to +9 m, so its length is \(9 - (-3) = 12\) meters.  
Segment B spans from +4 m to +15 m, so its length is \(15 - 4 = 11\) meters.  

The overlap occurs where both segments share the same region. The start of the overlap is the maximum of the starting points: \(\max(-3, 4) = 4\) m. The end of the overlap is the minimum of the ending points: \(\min(9, 15) = 9\) m.  
Thus, the overlap spans from 4 m to 9 m, and its length is \(9 - 4 = 5\) meters.  

This overlap of 5 meters as a percentage of segment A (12 meters) is calculated as:  
\[
\left( \frac{5}{12} \right) \times 100\% = \frac{500}{12}\% = \frac{125}{3}\% \approx 41.67\%.
\]  
Exactly, it is \(\frac{125}{3}\%\) or \(41 \frac{2}{3}\%\).  

Therefore:  
- The overlapping portion is **5 meters**.  
- As a percentage of segment A, it is **\(\frac{125}{3}\%\)** (or approximately **41.67%**).

\boxed{5} \text{ meters} \\
\boxed{\dfrac{125}{3}\%} \text{ of segment A}

## Grok 3
To determine the overlap between Segment A and Segment B, as well as express that overlap as a percentage of Segment A's length, let's proceed step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the ranges of the segments
- Segment A spans from -3 m to +9 m.
- Segment B spans from +4 m to +15 m.

### Step 2: Find the overlapping range
- The overlap between two segments occurs where both segments coexist, i.e., from the maximum of their starting points to the minimum of their ending points.
- Starting points: Segment A starts at -3 m, Segment B starts at +4 m. The maximum of these is +4 m.
- Ending points: Segment A ends at +9 m, Segment B ends at +15 m. The minimum of these is +9 m.
- Therefore, the overlap is from +4 m to +9 m.

### Step 3: Calculate the length of the overlap
- Overlap length = 9 m - 4 m = 5 m.

### Step 4: Calculate the length of Segment A
- Segment A spans from -3 m to +9 m.
- Length of Segment A = 9 m - (-3 m) = 9 m + 3 m = 12 m.

### Step 5: Calculate the overlap as a percentage of Segment A's length
- Percentage overlap = (Overlap length / Length of Segment A) × 100
- Percentage overlap = (5 m / 12 m) × 100 = 41.67% (rounded to two decimal places).

### Final Answer:
- The overlap is 5 meters.
- As a percentage of Segment A, the overlap is approximately 41.67%.
