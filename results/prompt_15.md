# Prompt #15: Reflect the point x = −12 across the line x = +5. Where is the image?

## OpenAI o3
A reflection across a vertical line keeps the y-coordinate the same and moves the x-coordinate an equal distance to the opposite side of the mirror line.

Distance from the point x = –12 to the mirror line x = 5:
5 − (−12) = 17 units.

Place the image 17 units to the right of x = 5:
5 + 17 = 22.

Therefore, the reflected point is at x = 22.

I need to find the reflection of the point x = -12 across the vertical line x = 5.

When reflecting a point across a vertical line, the vertical line acts as a mirror. The image will be the same distance from the line as the original point, but on the opposite side.

First, let me find the distance from x = -12 to the line x = 5:
Distance = 5 - (-12) = 5 + 12 = 17

Since the original point is to the left of the line (at x = -12), the image will be to the right of the line at the same distance.

The image will be at: x = 5 + 17 = 22

To verify: 
- Distance from -12 to 5: |5 - (-12)| = 17
- Distance from 22 to 5: |22 - 5| = 17 ✓
- The line x = 5 is exactly halfway between -12 and 22: (-12 + 22)/2 = 10/2 = 5 ✓

Therefore, the image is at x = 22.

Let the original point be P = -12.
Let the line of reflection be L at x = 5.
Let the image point be P'.

The distance from the original point P to the line of reflection L is:
Distance = |L - P| = |5 - (-12)| = |5 + 12| = |17| = 17 units.

The image P' will be the same distance on the other side of the line L.
So, P' = L + Distance
P' = 5 + 17
P' = 22

Alternatively, the line of reflection x = 5 is the midpoint between the original point and its image.
Let the image be at x'.
Then (P + x') / 2 = L
(-12 + x') / 2 = 5
-12 + x' = 5 * 2
-12 + x' = 10
x' = 10 + 12
x' = 22

The image is at x = 22.

## DeepSeek Reasoner
To reflect a point across a vertical line, the line of reflection acts as the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining the point to its image. This means the distance from the point to the line equals the distance from the line to the image point.

Given the point at \(x = -12\) and the line of reflection at \(x = 5\):

- The distance from the point to the line is \(|5 - (-12)| = |5 + 12| = |17| = 17\) units.
- Since the point is to the left of the line, the image will be to the right of the line at the same distance.
- Therefore, the x-coordinate of the image is \(5 + 17 = 22\).

Alternatively, using the reflection formula for a vertical line \(x = c\), the image of a point \(x\) is given by \(2c - x\):
- Here, \(c = 5\) and \(x = -12\), so the image is \(2(5) - (-12) = 10 + 12 = 22\).

Thus, the image of the point is at \(x = 22\).

\boxed{22}

## Grok 3
To reflect a point across a vertical line, we use the concept of symmetry. The line of reflection acts as the perpendicular bisector between the original point and its image. In this case, we are reflecting the point \( x = -12 \) across the line \( x = 5 \).

### Step 1: Understand the geometry of reflection
- The line of reflection is \( x = 5 \), which is a vertical line.
- The original point is at \( x = -12 \).
- The image point will be on the opposite side of the line \( x = 5 \), and the distance from the original point to the line will be equal to the distance from the line to the image point.

### Step 2: Calculate the distance from the original point to the line
- The x-coordinate of the original point is \( x = -12 \).
- The line of reflection is at \( x = 5 \).
- The distance between them is \( 5 - (-12) = 5 + 12 = 17 \) units.

### Step 3: Determine the position of the image
- Since the reflection places the image on the opposite side of the line, we move 17 units to the right of \( x = 5 \).
- Starting at \( x = 5 \), moving 17 units to the right gives \( 5 + 17 = 22 \).

### Step 4: Alternative method (using the reflection formula)
- For a point \( x = a \) reflected across a vertical line \( x = k \), the image is at \( x = 2k - a \).
- Here, \( a = -12 \) and \( k = 5 \).
- So, the image is at \( x = 2(5) - (-12) = 10 + 12 = 22 \).

### Final Answer:
The image of the point \( x = -12 \) after reflection across the line \( x = 5 \) is at \( x = 22 \).
