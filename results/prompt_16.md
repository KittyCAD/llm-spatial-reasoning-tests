# Prompt #16: Car X is at 0 km heading + direction at 90 km/h. Car Y is at +300 km heading − direction at 60 km/h. When and where do they meet?

## OpenAI o3
Let the origin of a straight-line road be the place where car X starts.

Position after t hours (measured in km)

• Car X: x_X(t) = 0 km + (90 km/h) t  
• Car Y: x_Y(t) = 300 km − (60 km/h) t  (the minus sign because it is moving toward the origin)

They meet when their positions are equal:

90 t = 300 − 60 t  
150 t = 300  
t = 2 h

Substitute t = 2 h into either position equation:

x = 90 km/h × 2 h = 180 km  
   (or 300 km − 60 km/h × 2 h = 180 km)

Hence

Time until meeting: 2 hours after the given starting instant.  
Meeting place: the point 180 km from car X’s start (or 120 km from car Y’s start).

## Claude 4 Sonnet
I need to find when and where the two cars meet.

Given information:
- Car X: starts at 0 km, heading in + direction at 90 km/h
- Car Y: starts at +300 km, heading in − direction at 60 km/h

Let me set up the position equations for both cars as functions of time t (in hours):
- Car X position: x_X(t) = 0 + 90t = 90t
- Car Y position: x_Y(t) = 300 - 60t

The cars meet when their positions are equal:
90t = 300 - 60t

Solving for t:
90t + 60t = 300
150t = 300
t = 2 hours

Now I can find where they meet by substituting t = 2 into either equation:
- Using Car X: position = 90(2) = 180 km
- Using Car Y: position = 300 - 60(2) = 300 - 120 = 180 km ✓

Therefore, the cars meet after 2 hours at the 180 km position.

Okay, let's solve this step-by-step.

Let:
*   `t` be the time in hours when they meet.
*   The meeting point be `P` km from the origin (0 km).

**For Car X:**
*   Initial position (x₀_X) = 0 km
*   Velocity (v_X) = +90 km/h
*   Position at time `t`: x_X(t) = x₀_X + v_X * t = 0 + 90t = 90t

**For Car Y:**
*   Initial position (x₀_Y) = +300 km
*   Velocity (v_Y) = -60 km/h (negative because it's heading in the − direction)
*   Position at time `t`: x_Y(t) = x₀_Y + v_Y * t = 300 - 60t

**When they meet, their positions are the same:**
x_X(t) = x_Y(t)
90t = 300 - 60t

**Solve for t (when they meet):**
90t + 60t = 300
150t = 300
t = 300 / 150
t = 2 hours

**Where they meet:**
Now substitute the value of `t` back into either car's position equation.
Using Car X's equation:
P = 90t = 90 * 2 = 180 km

Using Car Y's equation (to check):
P = 300 - 60t = 300 - 60 * 2 = 300 - 120 = 180 km

Both give the same result.

**Answer:**
*   **When:** They meet after **2 hours**.
*   **Where:** They meet at the **180 km** mark.

## DeepSeek Reasoner
Car X starts at position 0 km and moves in the positive direction at 90 km/h. Car Y starts at position +300 km and moves in the negative direction at 60 km/h. The cars are moving towards each other.

The position of Car X at time \(t\) hours is given by:  
\[ X(t) = 0 + 90t \text{ km} \]

The position of Car Y at time \(t\) hours is given by:  
\[ Y(t) = 300 - 60t \text{ km} \]

The cars meet when \( X(t) = Y(t) \):  
\[ 90t = 300 - 60t \]

Solving for \(t\):  
\[ 90t + 60t = 300 \]  
\[ 150t = 300 \]  
\[ t = \frac{300}{150} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

The meeting position is found by substituting \(t = 2\) into either position equation:  
\[ X(2) = 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ km} \]  
\[ Y(2) = 300 - 60 \times 2 = 300 - 120 = 180 \text{ km} \]

Alternatively, the relative speed at which the cars approach each other is \(90 + 60 = 150 \text{ km/h}\). The initial distance between them is 300 km, so the time to meet is:  
\[ t = \frac{300}{150} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

From Car X's starting point, it travels \(90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ km}\) to the meeting point. From Car Y's starting point, it travels \(60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ km}\) toward the negative direction, so the meeting point is \(300 - 120 = 180 \text{ km}\).

Thus, the cars meet after 2 hours at a position of 180 km.

**Answer:**  
- **When:** After 2 hours  
- **Where:** At 180 km from the origin (in the positive direction)

## Grok 3
To solve this problem, we need to determine when and where Car X and Car Y meet, given their initial positions, directions, and speeds. Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Interpret the problem and define the coordinate system
- We assume a straight line (e.g., a highway) as the path for both cars, with positions measured in kilometers (km) and time in hours (h).
- The "+" direction is taken as the positive direction (e.g., east), and the "−" direction is the negative direction (e.g., west).
- Car X starts at position 0 km, heading in the positive direction at 90 km/h.
- Car Y starts at position +300 km, heading in the negative direction at 60 km/h.
- Since Car X is moving in the positive direction and Car Y is moving in the negative direction, they are moving toward each other.

Thus:
- Initial position of Car X: \( x_X(0) = 0 \) km
- Velocity of Car X: \( v_X = +90 \) km/h (positive direction)
- Initial position of Car Y: \( x_Y(0) = 300 \) km
- Velocity of Car Y: \( v_Y = -60 \) km/h (negative direction)

---

### Step 2: Set up the position equations
The position of each car as a function of time \( t \) (in hours) can be described using the equation of motion:  
\[ \text{Position} = \text{Initial Position} + \text{Velocity} \times \text{Time} \]

- For Car X:  
  \[ x_X(t) = 0 + 90t = 90t \] km

- For Car Y:  
  \[ x_Y(t) = 300 + (-60)t = 300 - 60t \] km

---

### Step 3: Determine when they meet
The cars meet when their positions are equal, i.e., when \( x_X(t) = x_Y(t) \). So, we set the position equations equal to each other and solve for \( t \):

\[ 90t = 300 - 60t \]

Add \( 60t \) to both sides:  
\[ 90t + 60t = 300 \]  
\[ 150t = 300 \]

Divide both sides by 150:  
\[ t = \frac{300}{150} = 2 \] hours

So, the cars meet after 2 hours.

---

### Step 4: Determine where they meet
To find the meeting point, substitute \( t = 2 \) hours into either position equation.

Using Car X's position equation:  
\[ x_X(2) = 90 \times 2 = 180 \] km

Using Car Y's position equation (to verify):  
\[ x_Y(2) = 300 - 60 \times 2 = 300 - 120 = 180 \] km

Both give the same result, confirming the meeting point is at 180 km from the starting point of Car X (i.e., at position +180 km).

---

### Step 5: Alternative approach (relative speed)
We can also solve this using the concept of relative speed. Since the cars are moving toward each other:
- Relative speed = Speed of Car X + Speed of Car Y = 90 km/h + 60 km/h = 150 km/h
- Initial distance between them = 300 km - 0 km = 300 km
- Time to meet = Initial distance / Relative speed = 300 km / 150 km/h = 2 hours

Then, meeting point from Car X's starting position:  
Distance covered by Car X = Speed of Car X × Time = 90 km/h × 2 h = 180 km

This matches our earlier result.

---

### Final Answer:
The cars meet after **2 hours** at the position **+180 km**.
