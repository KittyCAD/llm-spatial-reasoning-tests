# Prompt #19: Three points: P = −8, Q = 4, R = 10. Shift every point +13. Then sort them left→right with their new coordinates.

## OpenAI o3
Add 13 to each original coordinate:

• P: −8 + 13 = 5  
• Q: 4  + 13 = 17  
• R: 10 + 13 = 23  

Sorted from left to right (smallest to largest):

P (5), Q (17), R (23)

## Claude 4 Sonnet
I need to shift each point by +13, then sort them from left to right.

Original points:
- P = -8
- Q = 4  
- R = 10

After shifting by +13:
- P: -8 + 13 = 5
- Q: 4 + 13 = 17
- R: 10 + 13 = 23

Now sorting from left to right (smallest to largest):
- P = 5 (leftmost)
- Q = 17 (middle)
- R = 23 (rightmost)

Therefore, the order from left to right is: **P, Q, R**

## Gemini Pro
Okay, let's do this step-by-step:

1.  **Initial Points:**
    *   P = -8
    *   Q = 4
    *   R = 10

2.  **Shift every point +13:**
    *   New P (P') = -8 + 13 = 5
    *   New Q (Q') = 4 + 13 = 17
    *   New R (R') = 10 + 13 = 23

3.  **Sort them left→right with their new coordinates:**
    The new coordinates are 5, 17, and 23.
    Sorting these from smallest to largest (left to right):
    *   P' = 5
    *   Q' = 17
    *   R' = 23

So the sorted order is **P' (at 5), Q' (at 17), R' (at 23)**.

## DeepSeek Reasoner
The original points are \(P = -8\), \(Q = 4\), and \(R = 10\).

Shift each point by \(+13\):
- \(P_{\text{new}} = -8 + 13 = 5\)
- \(Q_{\text{new}} = 4 + 13 = 17\)
- \(R_{\text{new}} = 10 + 13 = 23\)

The new coordinates are \(5\), \(17\), and \(23\).

Sorting these coordinates from left to right (smallest to largest):
- \(5\) (corresponding to \(P\))
- \(17\) (corresponding to \(Q\))
- \(23\) (corresponding to \(R\))

Thus, the points sorted left to right with their new coordinates are:
- \(P\) at \(5\)
- \(Q\) at \(17\)
- \(R\) at \(23\)

The order of the points is \(P\), \(Q\), \(R\).

\boxed{P} \boxed{Q} \boxed{R}

## Grok 3
Let's solve this step by step.

1. **Original points**: We are given three points on a number line with coordinates:
   - P = −8
   - Q = 4
   - R = 10

2. **Shift every point by +13**: This means we add 13 to each point's coordinate.
   - New P = −8 + 13 = 5
   - New Q = 4 + 13 = 17
   - New R = 10 + 13 = 23

3. **Sort the points from left to right**: On a number line, "left to right" means sorting in ascending order (smallest to largest).
   - New P = 5
   - New Q = 17
   - New R = 23
   So, the sorted order is P (5), Q (17), R (23).

**Final Answer**: The points, after shifting by +13 and sorting from left to right, are P = 5, Q = 17, R = 23.
