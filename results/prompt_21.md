# Prompt #21: Is the inequality  −2 < x ≤ 5 AND x > 3 equivalent to 3 < x ≤ 5? Explain.

## OpenAI o3
Yes.  
“AND” means that x must satisfy both conditions at the same time, so we take the intersection of the two sets of numbers they describe.

1. −2 < x ≤ 5 describes the interval (−2, 5].
2. x > 3 describes the interval (3, ∞).

The intersection of (−2, 5] and (3, ∞) is the set of numbers that are simultaneously greater than 3 and no larger than 5, i.e. (3, 5].

Written as a single compound inequality this is 3 < x ≤ 5.

Therefore  
(−2 < x ≤ 5) AND (x > 3)  ⇔  3 < x ≤ 5.

## Claude 4 Sonnet
Yes, the inequality −2 < x ≤ 5 AND x > 3 is equivalent to 3 < x ≤ 5.

Here's why:

When we have two inequalities connected by "AND," we need to find the values of x that satisfy **both** conditions simultaneously.

Let me visualize this:
- First condition: −2 < x ≤ 5 means x is between −2 and 5 (not including −2, but including 5)
- Second condition: x > 3 means x is greater than 3

On a number line:
- −2 < x ≤ 5: -----(−2)━━━━━━━━━━━━━━[5]----
- x > 3: --------------------(3)━━━━━━━━━→

The intersection (where both conditions are true) is:
- x must be greater than 3 (from the second condition)
- AND x must be less than or equal to 5 (from the first condition)

Therefore, the values that satisfy both conditions are: 3 < x ≤ 5

This is exactly what we get when we combine the inequalities - we take the more restrictive lower bound (3 instead of −2) and keep the upper bound (5).

Yes, the inequality −2 < x ≤ 5 AND x > 3 is equivalent to 3 < x ≤ 5.

Here's the explanation:

1.  **Analyze the first part: −2 < x ≤ 5**
    This means x is a number strictly greater than -2 and less than or equal to 5.
    On a number line, this would be an open circle at -2, a closed circle at 5, and the line segment connecting them.
    Numbers in this range include, for example: -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4.5, 5.

2.  **Analyze the second part: x > 3**
    This means x is a number strictly greater than 3.
    On a number line, this would be an open circle at 3 and an arrow pointing to the right (towards positive infinity).
    Numbers in this range include, for example: 3.1, 4, 5, 6, 100.

3.  **Combine with "AND"**
    The word "AND" means we are looking for numbers that satisfy *both* conditions simultaneously. This is the intersection of the two sets of numbers.

    *   Condition 1: x must be between -2 (exclusive) and 5 (inclusive).
    *   Condition 2: x must be greater than 3 (exclusive).

    To satisfy both:
    *   The lower bound for x must satisfy both x > -2 and x > 3. The more restrictive (larger) lower bound is x > 3.
    *   The upper bound for x is determined by the first condition, which is x ≤ 5. The second condition (x > 3) does not impose a more restrictive upper bound.

    Therefore, for x to satisfy both conditions, x must be strictly greater than 3 AND x must be less than or equal to 5.

4.  **Resulting Inequality:**
    Combining these, we get 3 < x ≤ 5.

5.  **Comparison:**
    The original compound inequality "−2 < x ≤ 5 AND x > 3" simplifies to "3 < x ≤ 5".
    The second inequality given is "3 < x ≤ 5".

Since both expressions represent the exact same set of numbers (all numbers strictly greater than 3 and less than or equal to 5), they are equivalent.

## DeepSeek Reasoner
Yes, the inequality \(-2 < x \leq 5\) AND \(x > 3\) is equivalent to \(3 < x \leq 5\).

### Explanation:
- The original inequality consists of two parts combined with AND:  
  - \(-2 < x \leq 5\) means \(x > -2\) and \(x \leq 5\).  
  - \(x > 3\) means \(x\) must be greater than 3.  
- Since both conditions must be true simultaneously (due to the AND), \(x\) must satisfy:  
  - \(x > -2\) and \(x \leq 5\) (from the first part),  
  - and \(x > 3\) (from the second part).  
- However, \(x > 3\) implies \(x > -2\) because 3 is greater than -2. Therefore, \(x > -2\) is redundant when \(x > 3\) is already required.  
- The relevant constraints simplify to \(x > 3\) and \(x \leq 5\), which is written as \(3 < x \leq 5\).

### Verification with test points:
- For \(x = 4\):  
  - Original: \(-2 < 4 \leq 5\) (true) and \(4 > 3\) (true) → true.  
  - Simplified: \(3 < 4 \leq 5\) (true).  
- For \(x = 3\):  
  - Original: \(-2 < 3 \leq 5\) (true) but \(3 > 3\) (false) → false.  
  - Simplified: \(3 < 3 \leq 5\) (false, since \(3 < 3\) is false).  
- For \(x = 5\):  
  - Original: \(-2 < 5 \leq 5\) (true) and \(5 > 3\) (true) → true.  
  - Simplified: \(3 < 5 \leq 5\) (true).  
- For \(x = 2\):  
  - Original: \(-2 < 2 \leq 5\) (true) but \(2 > 3\) (false) → false.  
  - Simplified: \(3 < 2 \leq 5\) (false, since \(3 < 2\) is false).  
- For \(x = 6\):  
  - Original: \(-2 < 6 \leq 5\) (false, since \(6 \leq 5\) is false) → false.  
  - Simplified: \(3 < 6 \leq 5\) (false, since \(6 \leq 5\) is false).  

### Conclusion:
The condition \(x > 3\) makes the lower bound \(x > -2\) unnecessary, reducing the original inequality to \(3 < x \leq 5\). Both expressions describe the same set of values: all real numbers greater than 3 and less than or equal to 5. Therefore, they are equivalent.

\boxed{\text{yes}}

## Grok 3
Yes, the inequality \(-2 < x \leq 5\) AND \(x > 3\) is equivalent to \(3 < x \leq 5\). Let's break this down step by step to explain why.

When we have two conditions combined with "AND," the solution set is the intersection of the solution sets of the individual inequalities. This means that \(x\) must satisfy both conditions simultaneously.

1. The first inequality, \(-2 < x \leq 5\), means that \(x\) is greater than \(-2\) and less than or equal to \(5\). So, \(x\) can take any value in the interval \((-2, 5]\).
2. The second inequality, \(x > 3\), means that \(x\) is greater than \(3\). So, \(x\) can take any value in the interval \((3, \infty)\).

Now, we need to find the values of \(x\) that satisfy both inequalities at the same time. This is the intersection of the two intervals \((-2, 5]\) and \((3, \infty)\).

- The interval \((-2, 5]\) includes all numbers from just above \(-2\) up to and including \(5\).
- The interval \((3, \infty)\) includes all numbers greater than \(3\) with no upper bound.

The intersection of these two intervals is the set of numbers that are both greater than \(3\) (from the second inequality) and less than or equal to \(5\) (from the first inequality). Therefore, the intersection is the interval \((3, 5]\), which can be written as \(3 < x \leq 5\).

To confirm this visually:
- On a number line, \((-2, 5]\) starts just after \(-2\) and ends at \(5\) (inclusive).
- The interval \((3, \infty)\) starts just after \(3\) and extends indefinitely to the right.
- The overlap between these two regions is from just after \(3\) up to and including \(5\), which is exactly \((3, 5]\) or \(3 < x \leq 5\).

Thus, the combined condition \(-2 < x \leq 5\) AND \(x > 3\) simplifies to \(3 < x \leq 5\), and they are indeed equivalent. The first inequality's lower bound of \(-2 < x\) is overridden by the stricter condition \(x > 3\) from the second inequality, while the upper bound remains \(x \leq 5\).
