# Prompt #22: Starting at −7, move right in steps of 5 until you pass +20. List every landing spot and state whether each is even or odd.

## OpenAI o3
Here are the landing spots, stopping once the first number greater than 20 is reached:

• −7  → odd  
• −2  → even  
•  3  → odd  
•  8  → even  
• 13  → odd  
• 18  → even  
• 23  → odd  (first position past +20)

So the sequence is: −7 (odd), −2 (even), 3 (odd), 8 (even), 13 (odd), 18 (even), 23 (odd).

I'll start at -7 and move right in steps of 5 until I pass +20.

Starting point: -7 (odd)

Step 1: -7 + 5 = -2 (even)
Step 2: -2 + 5 = 3 (odd)
Step 3: 3 + 5 = 8 (even)
Step 4: 8 + 5 = 13 (odd)
Step 5: 13 + 5 = 18 (even)
Step 6: 18 + 5 = 23 (odd)

Since 23 > 20, I've now passed +20.

Landing spots:
- -7 (odd)
- -2 (even)
- 3 (odd)
- 8 (even)
- 13 (odd)
- 18 (even)
- 23 (odd)

Let's track the landing spots:

1.  Start at -7.
2.  Move right by 5: -7 + 5 = **-2**
    *   -2 is not past +20.
    *   -2 is **Even**.
3.  Move right by 5: -2 + 5 = **+3**
    *   +3 is not past +20.
    *   +3 is **Odd**.
4.  Move right by 5: +3 + 5 = **+8**
    *   +8 is not past +20.
    *   +8 is **Even**.
5.  Move right by 5: +8 + 5 = **+13**
    *   +13 is not past +20.
    *   +13 is **Odd**.
6.  Move right by 5: +13 + 5 = **+18**
    *   +18 is not past +20.
    *   +18 is **Even**.
7.  Move right by 5: +18 + 5 = **+23**
    *   +23 *is* past +20. This is our final landing spot.
    *   +23 is **Odd**.

The landing spots are:
*   **-2** (Even)
*   **+3** (Odd)
*   **+8** (Even)
*   **+13** (Odd)
*   **+18** (Even)
*   **+23** (Odd)

## DeepSeek Reasoner
Starting at -7 and moving right in steps of 5, the landing spots are listed in order until the first spot greater than +20 is reached.

- The first landing spot is -7. Since -7 is not divisible by 2 (it has a remainder when divided by 2), it is odd.
- Moving right by 5: -7 + 5 = -2. Since -2 is divisible by 2 (it has no remainder when divided by 2), it is even.
- Moving right by 5: -2 + 5 = 3. Since 3 is not divisible by 2, it is odd.
- Moving right by 5: 3 + 5 = 8. Since 8 is divisible by 2, it is even.
- Moving right by 5: 8 + 5 = 13. Since 13 is not divisible by 2, it is odd.
- Moving right by 5: 13 + 5 = 18. Since 18 is divisible by 2, it is even.
- Moving right by 5: 18 + 5 = 23. Since 23 is not divisible by 2, it is odd.

The spot 23 is greater than +20, so the process stops here. No other landing spots are included, as 20 itself is not a landing spot (it is not part of the sequence starting from -7 with a step of 5).

The complete list of landing spots with their parity is:
- -7: odd
- -2: even
- 3: odd
- 8: even
- 13: odd
- 18: even
- 23: odd

\boxed{-7} \text{ (odd)}, \boxed{-2} \text{ (even)}, \boxed{3} \text{ (odd)}, \boxed{8} \text{ (even)}, \boxed{13} \text{ (odd)}, \boxed{18} \text{ (even)}, \boxed{23} \text{ (odd)}

## Grok 3
Let's solve this step by step.

- We start at -7 on a number line.
- We move right (which means adding positive values) in steps of 5.
- We continue this process until we pass +20 (i.e., until our position is greater than 20).
- For each landing spot, we will list the number and determine if it is even or odd.

### Step 1: Start at -7
- Landing spot: -7
- Is -7 even or odd? Odd (because it is not divisible by 2)

### Step 2: Move right by 5
- -7 + 5 = -2
- Landing spot: -2
- Is -2 even or odd? Even (because it is divisible by 2)

### Step 3: Move right by 5
- -2 + 5 = 3
- Landing spot: 3
- Is 3 even or odd? Odd (because it is not divisible by 2)

### Step 4: Move right by 5
- 3 + 5 = 8
- Landing spot: 8
- Is 8 even or odd? Even (because it is divisible by 2)

### Step 5: Move right by 5
- 8 + 5 = 13
- Landing spot: 13
- Is 13 even or odd? Odd (because it is not divisible by 2)

### Step 6: Move right by 5
- 13 + 5 = 18
- Landing spot: 18
- Is 18 even or odd? Even (because it is divisible by 2)

### Step 7: Move right by 5
- 18 + 5 = 23
- Landing spot: 23
- Is 23 even or odd? Odd (because it is not divisible by 2)
- Since 23 is greater than 20, we have passed +20 and can stop here.

### Final List of Landing Spots:
- -7 (Odd)
- -2 (Even)
- 3 (Odd)
- 8 (Even)
- 13 (Odd)
- 18 (Even)
- 23 (Odd)
