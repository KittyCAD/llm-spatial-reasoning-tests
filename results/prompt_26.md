# Prompt #26: Rectangle R spans (−3,−1) to (7,6). Another rectangle S is R translated by the vector (−4,−2). What are S’s corner coordinates, and how much do R and S overlap in area?

## OpenAI o3
Rectangle R  
x-range: −3 to 7  y-range: −1 to 6  
Corners: (−3,−1), (−3,6), (7,−1), (7,6)

Translate every point by (−4, −2):

S’s corners  
(−3−4, −1−2) = (−7, −3)  
(−3−4,  6−2) = (−7,  4)  
( 7−4, −1−2) = ( 3, −3)  
( 7−4,  6−2) = ( 3,  4)

So S spans x = −7…3 and y = −3…4.

Overlap of R and S  
x-overlap: max(−3, −7) to min(7, 3)  →  −3 … 3  (width = 6)  
y-overlap: max(−1, −3) to min(6, 4)  →  −1 … 4  (height = 5)

Overlap area = width × height = 6 × 5 = 30 square units.

I need to find the corners of rectangle S and then calculate the overlap area between R and S.

First, let me identify the corners of rectangle R:
- Rectangle R spans from (-3, -1) to (7, 6)
- The four corners of R are:
  - Bottom-left: (-3, -1)
  - Bottom-right: (7, -1)
  - Top-left: (-3, 6)
  - Top-right: (7, 6)

Now, to find rectangle S, I translate each corner of R by the vector (-4, -2):
- Bottom-left: (-3, -1) + (-4, -2) = (-7, -3)
- Bottom-right: (7, -1) + (-4, -2) = (3, -3)
- Top-left: (-3, 6) + (-4, -2) = (-7, 4)
- Top-right: (7, 6) + (-4, -2) = (3, 4)

So rectangle S spans from (-7, -3) to (3, 4).

To find the overlap area, I need to find the intersection rectangle:
- For the x-coordinates:
  - R spans from x = -3 to x = 7
  - S spans from x = -7 to x = 3
  - The overlap is from x = max(-3, -7) = -3 to x = min(7, 3) = 3
  - Width of overlap = 3 - (-3) = 6

- For the y-coordinates:
  - R spans from y = -1 to y = 6
  - S spans from y = -3 to y = 4
  - The overlap is from y = max(-1, -3) = -1 to y = min(6, 4) = 4
  - Height of overlap = 4 - (-1) = 5

Therefore:
- Rectangle S has corners at (-7, -3), (3, -3), (-7, 4), and (3, 4)
- The overlap area = width × height = 6 × 5 = 30 square units

Let the corners of rectangle R be (x1_R, y1_R) for the bottom-left and (x2_R, y2_R) for the top-right.
Given:
x1_R = -3
y1_R = -1
x2_R = 7
y2_R = 6

The four corners of R are:
1.  Bottom-left (BL_R): (-3, -1)
2.  Top-left (TL_R): (-3, 6) (same x as BL_R, same y as TR_R)
3.  Bottom-right (BR_R): (7, -1) (same x as TR_R, same y as BL_R)
4.  Top-right (TR_R): (7, 6)

Rectangle S is R translated by the vector v = (-4, -2). This means we subtract 4 from each x-coordinate and 2 from each y-coordinate of R's corners to get S's corners.

1.  **Corner Coordinates of S:**
    *   BL_S = (-3 - 4, -1 - 2) = (-7, -3)
    *   TL_S = (-3 - 4, 6 - 2) = (-7, 4)
    *   BR_S = (7 - 4, -1 - 2) = (3, -3)
    *   TR_S = (7 - 4, 6 - 2) = (3, 4)

    So, the corner coordinates of S are (-7, -3), (-7, 4), (3, -3), and (3, 4).
    For S, the bottom-left corner is (-7, -3) and the top-right corner is (3, 4).
    x1_S = -7
    y1_S = -3
    x2_S = 3
    y2_S = 4

2.  **Overlap Area:**
    To find the overlap, we need to find the intersection of the x-intervals and y-intervals of the two rectangles.
    Rectangle R: x-interval [x1_R, x2_R] = [-3, 7], y-interval [y1_R, y2_R] = [-1, 6]
    Rectangle S: x-interval [x1_S, x2_S] = [-7, 3], y-interval [y1_S, y2_S] = [-3, 4]

    The x-interval of the overlap is [max(x1_R, x1_S), min(x2_R, x2_S)]:
    Overlap_x_start = max(-3, -7) = -3
    Overlap_x_end = min(7, 3) = 3
    Width of overlap = Overlap_x_end - Overlap_x_start = 3 - (-3) = 6

    The y-interval of the overlap is [max(y1_R, y1_S), min(y2_R, y2_S)]:
    Overlap_y_start = max(-1, -3) = -1
    Overlap_y_end = min(6, 4) = 4
    Height of overlap = Overlap_y_end - Overlap_y_start = 4 - (-1) = 5

    If Width of overlap > 0 and Height of overlap > 0, then there is an overlap.
    Here, Width = 6 and Height = 5. Both are positive.
    Area of overlap = Width of overlap * Height of overlap = 6 * 5 = 30.

Final Answer:
The corner coordinates of S are **(-7, -3), (3, -3), (-7, 4), and (3, 4)**.
The area of overlap between R and S is **30 square units**.

Rectangle R is defined with corners at (−3, −1) (bottom-left) and (7, 6) (top-right). The translation vector is (−4, −2), meaning each point of R is shifted left by 4 units and down by 2 units to obtain rectangle S.

The corners of S are calculated as follows:
- Bottom-left of R: (−3, −1) → (−3 + (−4), −1 + (−2)) = (−7, −3)
- Bottom-right of R: (7, −1) → (7 + (−4), −1 + (−2)) = (3, −3)
- Top-left of R: (−3, 6) → (−3 + (−4), 6 + (−2)) = (−7, 4)
- Top-right of R: (7, 6) → (7 + (−4), 6 + (−2)) = (3, 4)

Thus, the corner coordinates of S are: (−7, −3), (3, −3), (−7, 4), and (3, 4).

To find the area of overlap between R and S:
- R spans x from −3 to 7 (width = 7 − (−3) = 10) and y from −1 to 6 (height = 6 − (−1) = 7).
- S spans x from −7 to 3 (width = 3 − (−7) = 10) and y from −3 to 4 (height = 4 − (−3) = 7).
- The overlap in the x-direction: the maximum of the left edges is max(−3, −7) = −3, and the minimum of the right edges is min(7, 3) = 3. Thus, the width of the overlap is 3 − (−3) = 6.
- The overlap in the y-direction: the maximum of the bottom edges is max(−1, −3) = −1, and the minimum of the top edges is min(6, 4) = 4. Thus, the height of the overlap is 4 − (−1) = 5.
- The area of overlap is the product of the overlap width and height: 6 × 5 = 30 square units.

Alternatively, using the translation vector (−4, −2), the absolute shifts are |Δx| = 4 and |Δy| = 2. The overlap dimensions are (width − |Δx|) = 10 − 4 = 6 and (height − |Δy|) = 7 − 2 = 5, giving an overlap area of 6 × 5 = 30 square units.

Thus, the corner coordinates of S are (−7, −3), (3, −3), (−7, 4), and (3, 4), and the area of overlap between R and S is 30 square units.

\boxed{(-7,\ -3)} \quad \boxed{(3,\ -3)} \quad \boxed{(-7,\ 4)} \quad \boxed{(3,\ 4)} \quad \boxed{30}

Let’s solve this step by step, focusing on clarity and detail.

### Step 1: Determine the corner coordinates of rectangle R
Rectangle R spans from (-3, -1) to (7, 6). This means the bottom-left corner is at (-3, -1) and the top-right corner is at (7, 6). Assuming a standard coordinate system where x increases to the right and y increases upward, the four corners of rectangle R are:
- Bottom-left: (-3, -1)
- Bottom-right: (7, -1)
- Top-left: (-3, 6)
- Top-right: (7, 6)

### Step 2: Translate rectangle R by the vector (-4, -2) to get rectangle S
Translating a point by a vector (dx, dy) means adding dx to the x-coordinate and dy to the y-coordinate of each point. Here, the translation vector is (-4, -2), so we subtract 4 from each x-coordinate and subtract 2 from each y-coordinate of R’s corners to find S’s corners:
- Bottom-left of S: (-3 - 4, -1 - 2) = (-7, -3)
- Bottom-right of S: (7 - 4, -1 - 2) = (3, -3)
- Top-left of S: (-3 - 4, 6 - 2) = (-7, 4)
- Top-right of S: (3, 4)

Thus, the corner coordinates of rectangle S are:
- (-7, -3)
- (3, -3)
- (-7, 4)
- (3, 4)

### Step 3: Calculate the dimensions of rectangles R and S
Since translation does not change the size or shape of a rectangle, R and S have the same dimensions.
- Width of R: 7 - (-3) = 10 units
- Height of R: 6 - (-1) = 7 units
- Therefore, area of R = 10 * 7 = 70 square units
- Similarly, area of S = 70 square units

### Step 4: Determine the overlapping region between R and S
To find the overlap, we need to determine the intersection of the two rectangles. The intersection of two axis-aligned rectangles can be found by:
- Finding the overlap in the x-direction: the range of x-values common to both rectangles.
- Finding the overlap in the y-direction: the range of y-values common to both rectangles.

For rectangle R:
- x-range: from -3 to 7
- y-range: from -1 to 6

For rectangle S:
- x-range: from -7 to 3
- y-range: from -3 to 4

Now, compute the overlap:
- Overlap in x-direction: max(-3, -7) to min(7, 3) = -3 to 3
  - Width of overlap = 3 - (-3) = 6 units
- Overlap in y-direction: max(-1, -3) to min(6, 4) = -1 to 4
  - Height of overlap = 4 - (-1) = 5 units

Since both the width and height of the overlap are positive, there is an overlapping region.

### Step 5: Calculate the area of overlap
The area of the overlapping rectangle is the product of the overlapping width and height:
- Overlap area = 6 * 5 = 30 square units

### Final Answer:
- The corner coordinates of rectangle S are: (-7, -3), (3, -3), (-7, 4), and (3, 4).
- The overlapping area between rectangles R and S is 30 square units.
