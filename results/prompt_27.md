# Prompt #27: A regular hexagon of side 5 cm is circumscribed by a circle. What is the circle’s radius, and what fraction of its area lies outside the hexagon?

## OpenAI o3
1. Radius of the circumscribed circle  
For a regular hexagon every side subtends 60° at the centre, so the six radii form six congruent equilateral triangles.  
Hence the distance from the centre to any vertex (the circum-radius R) equals the side length a.

 a = 5 cm  ⇒ R = 5 cm.

2. Areas  
• Circle: A_c = πR² = π·5² = 25π cm².  
• Regular hexagon: A_h = (3√3/2)a² = (3√3/2)·5² = 75√3/2 cm².

3. Fraction of the circle that lies outside the hexagon  
Outside area = A_c − A_h = 25π − 75√3/2.  
Fraction outside = (A_c − A_h)/A_c  
  = [25π − 75√3/2] / 25π  
  = 1 − (75√3)/(50π)  
  = 1 − (3√3)/(2π)  
  = (2π − 3√3)/(2π).

Numerically: (2π − 3√3)/(2π) ≈ 0.173, i.e. about 17.3 %.

Answer  
Circle radius: 5 cm.  
Fraction of the circle’s area outside the hexagon: (2π − 3√3)/(2π) ≈ 17 %.

I need to find the radius of the circle circumscribing a regular hexagon with side length 5 cm, then calculate what fraction of the circle's area lies outside the hexagon.

First, let me find the radius of the circumscribed circle.

For a regular hexagon, I can divide it into 6 equilateral triangles by drawing lines from the center to each vertex. Each triangle has:
- Two sides equal to the radius r (from center to vertices)
- One side equal to 5 cm (the hexagon's side)

Since these are equilateral triangles, all sides must be equal, so:
r = 5 cm

Alternatively, I can verify this using the formula for a regular polygon. For a regular hexagon with side length s, the radius of the circumscribed circle is:
r = s/(2 sin(π/6)) = s/(2 × 1/2) = s = 5 cm

Now I need to find what fraction of the circle's area lies outside the hexagon.

Area of the circle:
A_circle = πr² = π(5)² = 25π cm²

Area of the regular hexagon:
A regular hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles, each with side length 5 cm.

Area of one equilateral triangle with side s:
A_triangle = (s²√3)/4 = (25√3)/4 cm²

Area of hexagon:
A_hexagon = 6 × (25√3)/4 = (150√3)/4 = (75√3)/2 cm²

Area outside the hexagon:
A_outside = A_circle - A_hexagon = 25π - (75√3)/2 cm²

Fraction of circle's area outside the hexagon:
Fraction = A_outside/A_circle = (25π - (75√3)/2)/(25π)
         = 1 - (75√3)/(50π)
         = 1 - (3√3)/(2π)

Let me calculate the numerical value:
3√3 ≈ 3 × 1.732 = 5.196
2π ≈ 6.283
(3√3)/(2π) ≈ 5.196/6.283 ≈ 0.827

Therefore: Fraction ≈ 1 - 0.827 = 0.173 or about 17.3%

The circle's radius is 5 cm, and approximately 17.3% (or exactly 1 - (3√3)/(2π)) of its area lies outside the hexagon.

Let the side length of the regular hexagon be 's'. We are given s = 5 cm.

1.  **Radius of the Circle:**
    A regular hexagon can be divided into 6 congruent equilateral triangles, with their common vertex at the center of the hexagon. The sides of these equilateral triangles are equal to the distance from the center to any vertex of the hexagon.
    When a circle circumscribes a regular hexagon, the vertices of the hexagon lie on the circle. The distance from the center of the circle (which is also the center of the hexagon) to any vertex of the hexagon is the radius (R) of the circle.
    Since these distances form the sides of the equilateral triangles, and one side of each equilateral triangle is also a side of the hexagon (s), it follows that:
    Radius (R) = side length of hexagon (s)
    So, R = 5 cm.

2.  **Area of the Circle:**
    Area_circle = π * R²
    Area_circle = π * (5 cm)²
    Area_circle = 25π cm²

3.  **Area of the Hexagon:**
    The area of a regular hexagon with side 's' is given by the area of 6 equilateral triangles with side 's'.
    Area of one equilateral triangle = (√3 / 4) * s²
    Area_hexagon = 6 * (√3 / 4) * s²
    Area_hexagon = (6√3 / 4) * s²
    Area_hexagon = (3√3 / 2) * s²
    Substitute s = 5 cm:
    Area_hexagon = (3√3 / 2) * (5 cm)²
    Area_hexagon = (3√3 / 2) * 25 cm²
    Area_hexagon = (75√3 / 2) cm²

4.  **Area of the Circle Outside the Hexagon:**
    Area_outside = Area_circle - Area_hexagon
    Area_outside = 25π - (75√3 / 2) cm²

5.  **Fraction of the Circle's Area Outside the Hexagon:**
    Fraction = Area_outside / Area_circle
    Fraction = (25π - (75√3 / 2)) / (25π)
    We can divide both terms in the numerator by 25π:
    Fraction = (25π / 25π) - ((75√3 / 2) / (25π))
    Fraction = 1 - (75√3) / (2 * 25π)
    Fraction = 1 - (3 * 25 * √3) / (2 * 25 * π)
    Fraction = 1 - (3√3) / (2π)

**Answers:**
*   The circle's radius is **5 cm**.
*   The fraction of the circle's area that lies outside the hexagon is **1 - (3√3) / (2π)**.

To give an approximate numerical value for the fraction:
√3 ≈ 1.732
π ≈ 3.14159
(3√3) / (2π) ≈ (3 * 1.732) / (2 * 3.14159) ≈ 5.196 / 6.28318 ≈ 0.82699
Fraction ≈ 1 - 0.82699 ≈ 0.17301
So, approximately 17.3% of the circle's area lies outside the hexagon.

The regular hexagon has a side length of 5 cm and is circumscribed by a circle, meaning the circle passes through all six vertices of the hexagon. For a regular hexagon, the radius of the circumscribed circle is equal to the side length. Therefore, the radius is 5 cm.

The area of the circle is given by \(A_{\text{circle}} = \pi r^2 = \pi \times 5^2 = 25\pi\) cm².

The area of a regular hexagon with side length \(s\) is given by \(A_{\text{hex}} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2\). Substituting \(s = 5\) cm:
\[
A_{\text{hex}} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 5^2 = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 25 = \frac{75\sqrt{3}}{2} \text{ cm}^2.
\]

The area of the circle that lies outside the hexagon is the difference between the area of the circle and the area of the hexagon:
\[
A_{\text{outside}} = A_{\text{circle}} - A_{\text{hex}} = 25\pi - \frac{75\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

The fraction of the circle's area that lies outside the hexagon is:
\[
\text{Fraction} = \frac{A_{\text{outside}}}{A_{\text{circle}}} = \frac{25\pi - \frac{75\sqrt{3}}{2}}{25\pi}.
\]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[
\text{Fraction} = \frac{25\pi}{25\pi} - \frac{\frac{75\sqrt{3}}{2}}{25\pi} = 1 - \frac{75\sqrt{3}}{2 \times 25\pi} = 1 - \frac{75\sqrt{3}}{50\pi} = 1 - \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2\pi}.
\]

Alternatively, the fraction can be expressed as:
\[
\text{Fraction} = \frac{2\pi - 3\sqrt{3}}{2\pi}.
\]

Both forms are equivalent, but the fractional form \(\frac{2\pi - 3\sqrt{3}}{2\pi}\) is used for clarity.

Thus, the circle's radius is 5 cm, and the fraction of its area that lies outside the hexagon is \(\frac{2\pi - 3\sqrt{3}}{2\pi}\).

\[
\boxed{5\ \text{cm},\ \dfrac{2\pi - 3\sqrt{3}}{2\pi}}
\]

## Grok 3
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Find the radius of the circumscribed circle
A regular hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles, each with a side length equal to the side of the hexagon. Here, the side length of the hexagon is 5 cm.

In a regular hexagon, the radius of the circumscribed circle (the circle that passes through all vertices of the hexagon) is equal to the side length of the hexagon. This is because the distance from the center of the hexagon to any vertex is the same as the side length.

Thus, the radius \( R \) of the circumscribed circle is:
\[
R = 5 \, \text{cm}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the area of the circle
The area of a circle is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Area of circle} = \pi R^2
\]
Substituting \( R = 5 \, \text{cm} \):
\[
\text{Area of circle} = \pi \cdot (5)^2 = 25\pi \, \text{cm}^2
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the area of the regular hexagon
A regular hexagon with side length \( s \) has an area given by the formula:
\[
\text{Area of hexagon} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2
\]
Substituting \( s = 5 \, \text{cm} \):
\[
\text{Area of hexagon} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot (5)^2 = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 25 = \frac{75\sqrt{3}}{2} \, \text{cm}^2
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the area outside the hexagon but inside the circle
The area outside the hexagon but within the circle is the difference between the area of the circle and the area of the hexagon:
\[
\text{Area outside hexagon} = \text{Area of circle} - \text{Area of hexagon} = 25\pi - \frac{75\sqrt{3}}{2} \, \text{cm}^2
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the fraction of the circle’s area that lies outside the hexagon
The fraction of the circle’s area that lies outside the hexagon is the ratio of the area outside the hexagon to the total area of the circle:
\[
\text{Fraction outside} = \frac{\text{Area outside hexagon}}{\text{Area of circle}} = \frac{25\pi - \frac{75\sqrt{3}}{2}}{25\pi} = 1 - \frac{\frac{75\sqrt{3}}{2}}{25\pi} = 1 - \frac{75\sqrt{3}}{50\pi} = 1 - \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2\pi}
\]

Simplifying further:
\[
\text{Fraction outside} = 1 - \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2\pi}
\]

This can be left as an exact expression, or we can approximate it numerically if needed. Using approximate values (\( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \) and \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \)):
\[
\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2\pi} \approx \frac{3 \cdot 1.732}{2 \cdot 3.1416} \approx \frac{5.196}{6.2832} \approx 0.827
\]
\[
\text{Fraction outside} \approx 1 - 0.827 = 0.173
\]
So, approximately 17.3% of the circle’s area lies outside the hexagon. However, the exact form \( 1 - \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2\pi} \) is typically preferred unless a numerical approximation is specifically requested.

### Final Answer:
- The radius of the circle is \( 5 \, \text{cm} \).
- The fraction of the circle’s area that lies outside the hexagon is \( 1 - \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2\pi} \).
