# Prompt #28: Fold a square paper 16 cm on a side along its main diagonal. Punch a hole 2 cm from the fold and 5 cm from one short edge. After unfolding, mark all hole locations.

## OpenAI o3
Label the square before it is folded with the usual coordinate axes:

  O(0,0) A(16,0) B(16,16) C(0,16)

The paper is folded on the diagonal OC (the line y = x).  
A point (x , y) that is p cm from the fold satisfies

 distance from y = x = |x – y|/√2 = p.

Here p = 2 cm, so

 |x – y| = 2√2. (1)

While the sheet is folded we see an isosceles right-triangle whose two equal (“short’’) edges are the original sides OA (the x-axis) and OC (the y-axis).  
The hole is also 5 cm from one of those short edges, so its perpendicular distance to that edge is 5 cm.

There are two possibilities.

1. 5 cm from the bottom edge OA (y = 0).  
 Then y = 5 and, from (1),

  x – 5 = 2√2 ⇒ x = 5 + 2√2.

 Hence the point on the folded sheet is P₁(5 + 2√2 , 5).

 Because the paper is two layers thick, the punch gives another hole, P₂,
 the reflection of P₁ in the fold y = x :

  P₂(5 , 5 + 2√2).

2. 5 cm from the left edge OC (x = 0).  
 Then x = 5 and (1) gives

  5 – y = 2√2 ⇒ y = 5 – 2√2.

 So the punched point is Q₁(5 , 5 – 2√2),

 with its mirror image in the fold

  Q₂(5 – 2√2 , 5).

After the sheet is opened out, all the holes appear on the original square.  
Measured from the lower-left corner O they are

 Q₂(5 – 2√2 , 5) ≈ (2.17 cm , 5 cm)  
 Q₁(5 , 5 – 2√2) ≈ (5 cm , 2.17 cm)  
 P₁(5 + 2√2 , 5) ≈ (7.83 cm , 5 cm)  
 P₂(5 , 5 + 2√2) ≈ (5 cm , 7.83 cm)

Thus, when the square is unfolded you mark four holes: two on the horizontal line 5 cm above the bottom edge and two on the vertical line 5 cm to the right of the left edge, all symmetric with respect to the diagonal.

## Claude 4 Sonnet
I need to analyze what happens when we fold a square paper along its diagonal and punch a hole.

Given information:
- Square paper: 16 cm × 16 cm
- Fold along main diagonal
- Hole punched 2 cm from the fold and 5 cm from one short edge

Let me set up a coordinate system with the origin at one corner of the square.

Setting up coordinates:
- Place the square with corners at (0,0), (16,0), (16,16), and (0,16)
- The main diagonal runs from (0,0) to (16,16)

When we fold along this diagonal:
- The fold line is y = x
- The upper triangle (above y = x) folds onto the lower triangle

Finding the hole location:
- After folding, we have a right triangle with the fold as the hypotenuse
- The "short edges" are the two legs of this triangle
- The hole is 2 cm from the fold and 5 cm from one short edge

To find the position, I need to determine which short edge and measure perpendicular to the fold line.

If measuring from the edge at (0,0) to (16,0):
- 5 cm along this edge gives us the point (5,0)
- From here, move 2 cm perpendicular to the fold line y = x
- The perpendicular direction to y = x is along the line y = -x + 5
- Moving 2 cm perpendicular means moving √2 cm in both x and y directions
- This gives us the point (5 + √2, √2)

When we fold along y = x, this point maps to its reflection across the line y = x.
The reflection of point (a,b) across y = x is (b,a).

So when we punch the hole and unfold:
- First hole location: (5 + √2, √2) ≈ (6.41, 1.41)
- Second hole location: (√2, 5 + √2) ≈ (1.41, 6.41)

Therefore, after unfolding, there will be **two holes** at approximately:
- (6.41, 1.41) cm from the origin
- (1.41, 6.41) cm from the origin

These two holes are symmetric with respect to the diagonal fold line y = x.

## Gemini Pro
Let's define the corners of the square paper. Let the vertices be D(0,0), C(16,0), B(16,16), and A(0,16). The side length is 16 cm.

1.  **The Fold:**
    The paper is folded along a main diagonal. Let's choose the diagonal AC. The vertices are A(0,16) and C(16,0). The equation of the line AC is x + y = 16.
    When folded along AC, point B(16,16) lands on point D(0,0) (or vice-versa, D on B).
    The folded paper forms an isosceles right triangle with vertices D(0,0), C(16,0), and A(0,16). Let's call this triangle ADC. The fold itself is the segment AC (the hypotenuse of this triangle). The "short edges" of this folded triangle are DC (along the x-axis) and DA (along the y-axis). Both are 16 cm long.

2.  **Locating the Hole in the Folded Paper:**
    A hole is punched in this folded triangle ADC. Let the location of this hole be P₀ = (x₀, y₀).
    The hole is:
    *   a) 2 cm from the fold (line AC: x + y - 16 = 0).
    *   b) 5 cm from one short edge. Let's choose the short edge DC (which lies on the x-axis, y=0).

    From condition (b), the distance from (x₀, y₀) to the line y=0 is |y₀|. Since the hole must be within the triangle, y₀ > 0. So, y₀ = 5 cm.

    From condition (a), the distance from (x₀, 5) to the line x + y - 16 = 0 is 2 cm.
    The distance formula is |Ax₀ + By₀ + C| / √(A² + B²).
    So, |x₀ + 5 - 16| / √(1² + 1²) = 2
    |x₀ - 11| / √2 = 2
    |x₀ - 11| = 2√2

    This gives two possibilities:
    *   x₀ - 11 = 2√2  => x₀ = 11 + 2√2
    *   x₀ - 11 = -2√2 => x₀ = 11 - 2√2

    The hole P₀ must lie within the triangle ADC. This means x₀ > 0, y₀ > 0, and x₀ + y₀ < 16 (to be on the D-side of the fold line AC).
    Let's check:
    *   If x₀ = 11 + 2√2:
        x₀ + y₀ = (11 + 2√2) + 5 = 16 + 2√2. This is greater than 16, so this point is on the opposite side of the fold AC, outside the triangle ADC. This is not where the physical hole is punched through the paper.
    *   If x₀ = 11 - 2√2:
        x₀ + y₀ = (11 - 2√2) + 5 = 16 - 2√2. This is less than 16, so this point is inside the triangle ADC.
        Numerically, 2√2 ≈ 2 × 1.414 = 2.828. So x₀ ≈ 11 - 2.828 = 8.172 cm. This is positive.
    So, the hole P₀ in the folded paper (triangle ADC) is at coordinates (11 - 2√2, 5).

3.  **Unfolding the Paper and Marking Hole Locations:**
    When the paper is unfolded, there will be two holes because the punch went through two layers of paper (unless the hole was on the fold itself).
    *   **Hole 1 (H₁):** This is the hole P₀ itself, located on the part of the square that didn't move during the fold (triangle ADC).
        H₁ = P₀ = (11 - 2√2, 5) cm.

    *   **Hole 2 (H₂):** This hole is on the part of the square that was folded over (triangle ABC, which was originally superimposed on triangle ADC with B on D). Its location is the reflection of P₀ across the fold line AC (x + y - 16 = 0).
        Let P₀ = (x₁, y₁) = (11 - 2√2, 5). Let H₂ = (x₂, y₂).
        The formula for reflection of (x₁, y₁) across ax + by + c = 0 is:
        (x₂ - x₁) / a = (y₂ - y₁) / b = -2(ax₁ + by₁ + c) / (a² + b²)
        Here, a=1, b=1, c=-16.
        The term -2(ax₁ + by₁ + c) / (a² + b²) = -2((11 - 2√2) + 5 - 16) / (1² + 1²)
        = -2(16 - 2√2 - 16) / 2
        = -2(-2√2) / 2 = 2√2.
        So:
        (x₂ - (11 - 2√2)) / 1 = 2√2  => x₂ = 11 - 2√2 + 2√2 = 11 cm.
        (y₂ - 5) / 1 = 2√2  => y₂ = 5 + 2√2 cm.
        So, H₂ = (11, 5 + 2√2) cm.

The two hole locations after unfolding are:
1.  H₁ = (11 - 2√2, 5) cm
2.  H₂ = (11, 5 + 2√2) cm

Let's approximate these values:
2√2 ≈ 2.828 cm
H₁ ≈ (11 - 2.828, 5) = (8.172, 5) cm.
H₂ ≈ (11, 5 + 2.828) = (11, 7.828) cm.

Both points are within the 16cm x 16cm square.

Note: If we had chosen the other short edge (DA, along the y-axis) for the 5cm measurement, the coordinates of P₀ would have been (5, 11 - 2√2). This would lead to unfolded holes at (5, 11 - 2√2) and (5 + 2√2, 11). The problem implies making one choice for "one short edge". We've made a consistent choice. The choice of diagonal (AC or BD) would also lead to a symmetrically equivalent set of points. The solution provided is for the specific choices made (Fold AC, short edge DC).

Final hole locations to be marked:
*   **Hole 1:** (11 - 2√2 cm, 5 cm)
*   **Hole 2:** (11 cm, 5 + 2√2 cm)

These coordinates are relative to one corner of the square (D at (0,0)), with sides along the x and y axes.

Sketch:
Imagine a square with vertices D(0,0), C(16,0), B(16,16), A(0,16).
The fold is AC.
Hole 1 is in triangle ADC. x ≈ 8.17, y = 5.
Hole 2 is in triangle ABC. x = 11, y ≈ 7.83.

Final Answer: The two hole locations are (11 - 2√2, 5) cm and (11, 5 + 2√2) cm, measured from the corner D(0,0) along the edges DC and DA respectively.

## DeepSeek Reasoner
To determine the hole locations after folding and unfolding the square paper, consider the following steps:

- The square paper is 16 cm on each side. Assign coordinates with the bottom-left corner at (0,0), the bottom-right corner at (16,0), the top-right corner at (16,16), and the top-left corner at (0,16).
- Folding along the main diagonal from (0,0) to (16,16) (the line \(y = x\)) creates a folded state where the paper forms a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (16,16), and (0,16). The fold line is the hypotenuse from (0,0) to (16,16), and the short edges are from (0,0) to (0,16) (left edge) and from (0,16) to (16,16) (top edge).
- In the folded state, a hole is punched 2 cm from the fold and 5 cm from one short edge. Assuming the measurement is from the left short edge (x=0):
  - The perpendicular distance to the fold line \(y = x\) is given by \(\frac{|y - x|}{\sqrt{2}} = 2\), so \(|y - x| = 2\sqrt{2}\).
  - Since the point must be in the folded paper region where \(y \geq x\), \(y - x = 2\sqrt{2}\).
  - The distance to the left edge (x=0) is 5 cm, so x = 5.
  - Substituting x = 5 into \(y = x + 2\sqrt{2}\) gives \(y = 5 + 2\sqrt{2}\).
  - Thus, the hole is punched at the point (5, \(5 + 2\sqrt{2}\)) in the folded state coordinates.
- Punching the hole through both layers in the folded state results in two hole locations after unfolding:
  - One hole corresponds to the original position at (5, \(5 + 2\sqrt{2}\)).
  - The other hole corresponds to the reflection over the fold line \(y = x\), which swaps the coordinates, resulting in (\(5 + 2\sqrt{2}\), 5).

The hole locations are therefore at (5, \(5 + 2\sqrt{2}\)) and (\(5 + 2\sqrt{2}\), 5), with distances measured in centimeters from the bottom-left corner.

- For the point (5, \(5 + 2\sqrt{2}\)):
  - It is 5 cm from the left edge (x=0).
  - It is \(5 + 2\sqrt{2}\) cm from the bottom edge (y=0).
  - It is 2 cm from the fold line \(y = x\) (since \(\frac{|(5 + 2\sqrt{2}) - 5|}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = 2\)).
- For the point (\(5 + 2\sqrt{2}\), 5):
  - It is \(5 + 2\sqrt{2}\) cm from the left edge (x=0).
  - It is 5 cm from the bottom edge (y=0).
  - It is 2 cm from the fold line \(y = x\) (since \(\frac{|(5 + 2\sqrt{2}) - 5|}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = 2\)).

Both points are within the square, as \(5 + 2\sqrt{2} \approx 5 + 2.828 = 7.828 < 16\).

After unfolding, mark the hole locations at coordinates (5, \(5 + 2\sqrt{2}\)) and (\(5 + 2\sqrt{2}\), 5) relative to the bottom-left corner of the square.

\boxed{(5,\ 5 + 2\sqrt{2})} \quad \boxed{(5 + 2\sqrt{2},\ 5)}

## Grok 3
Let's solve this step by step to determine the locations of the holes after unfolding the square paper.

1. **Understand the setup**: We start with a square piece of paper with each side measuring 16 cm. The paper is folded along its main diagonal, which means folding one corner to the opposite corner, creating a crease that divides the square into two congruent right-angled triangles. The main diagonal of a square with side length 16 cm can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem as:
   \[
   \text{Diagonal} = \sqrt{16^2 + 16^2} = \sqrt{256 + 256} = \sqrt{512} = 16\sqrt{2} \text{ cm}.
   \]
   However, we don't need the exact length of the diagonal for this problem, as we'll work with coordinates or relative positions.

2. **Visualize the fold**: Place the square on a coordinate plane with vertices at (0,0), (16,0), (16,16), and (0,16). The main diagonal runs from (0,0) to (16,16). When folded along this diagonal, the point (16,0) maps to (0,16) and vice versa, because the fold reflects points over the line y = x. Specifically:
   - Points on one side of the diagonal are mirrored to the other side.
   - A point (a,b) is reflected over the line y = x to (b,a).

3. **Locate the hole while folded**: A hole is punched 2 cm from the fold (the diagonal) and 5 cm from one short edge. When the paper is folded along the diagonal, the "short edges" are the edges of the folded shape. After folding, the paper forms a right-angled triangle with legs of 16 cm and a hypotenuse of \(16\sqrt{2}\) cm. The "short edges" likely refer to the legs of this triangle (the original sides of the square that are now folded together).

   Let's interpret "one short edge" as one of the legs of the folded triangle. Assume the square is folded such that (0,0) and (16,16) are the endpoints of the diagonal, and the fold is along y = x. After folding:
   - The edge from (0,0) to (16,0) and the edge from (0,0) to (0,16) are relevant.
   - In the folded state, points along the bottom edge (16,0) to (0,0) are mapped to points along the left edge (0,16) to (0,0), but we need to place the hole relative to the fold and an edge.

   Since the hole is 5 cm from one short edge, let's assume the short edge is from (0,0) to (16,0) in the unfolded state, but we need to consider the folded configuration. In the folded state, the short edges are the two legs meeting at the right angle (originally sides of the square).

   Let's place the hole in the folded state. Assume the folded triangle has vertices at (0,0), (16,0), and (0,16), with the fold along y = x. The right angle is at (0,0), and the short edges are from (0,0) to (16,0) and (0,0) to (0,16). If the hole is 5 cm from one short edge, say from (0,0) to (16,0), then along that edge, at 5 cm from (0,0), it would be at (5,0) if it were on the edge. However, it's also 2 cm from the fold (the diagonal y = x).

   The distance from a point (x,y) to the line y = x is given by:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \frac{|x - y|}{\sqrt{2}}.
   \]
   We need this distance to be 2 cm:
   \[
   \frac{|x - y|}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \implies |x - y| = 2\sqrt{2}.
   \]
   Additionally, the hole is 5 cm from one short edge, say the edge along x=0 (from (0,0) to (0,16)), so the x-coordinate is 5 cm from x=0, meaning x=5 (if we choose the other edge, we adjust accordingly).

   Let's assume it's 5 cm from the edge x=0, so x=5. Then, distance to y=x is:
   \[
   \frac{|5 - y|}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \implies |5 - y| = 2\sqrt{2}.
   \]
   Solving for y:
   \[
   5 - y = 2\sqrt{2} \quad \text{or} \quad 5 - y = -2\sqrt{2},
   \]
   \[
   y = 5 - 2\sqrt{2} \quad \text{or} \quad y = 5 + 2\sqrt{2}.
   \]
   Since \(2\sqrt{2} \approx 2.828\), y is approximately 2.172 or 7.828, both within the 0 to 16 range.

   We must ensure the point is within the folded region. Since the fold is along y=x, and we are considering the triangle with points where x and y are between 0 and 16, and for the folded part, we consider points where y ≤ x or adjust based on reflection. Let's test both possibilities.

   Alternatively, if it's 5 cm from the edge y=0 (bottom edge), then y=5, and:
   \[
   \frac{|x - 5|}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \implies |x - 5| = 2\sqrt{2},
   \]
   \[
   x = 5 + 2\sqrt{2} \quad \text{or} \quad x = 5 - 2\sqrt{2}.
   \]
   Again, x ≈ 7.828 or 2.172, both within range.

   We need to decide which edge makes sense. Let's assume it's from the bottom edge for consistency with typical problem interpretations, so the hole is at (5, 5 - 2√2) or (5, 5 + 2√2), but let's calculate based on y=5.

   If y=5, distance to y=x:
   \[
   \frac{|x - 5|}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \implies x - 5 = ±2\sqrt{2} \implies x = 5 ± 2\sqrt{2}.
   \]
   Points are (5 + 2√2, 5) or (5 - 2√2, 5). In the folded state, we need the point to be within the folded triangle. If the fold maps (16,0) to (0,16), the folded region might be points where x ≥ y or y ≥ x, depending on how it's folded. Typically, folding along the diagonal from (0,0) to (16,16), the point (5 - 2√2, 5) where 5 - 2√2 ≈ 2.172, so (2.172, 5), here y > x, and (5 + 2√2, 5) ≈ (7.828, 5), x > y. We take one point based on the fold orientation.

4. **Reflection due to fold**: Since the paper is folded, punching a hole at one point creates a hole at the reflected point as well. If the hole is at (x,y), the reflected point over y=x is (y,x). So, for a hole at (5 - 2√2, 5), the reflected point is (5, 5 - 2√2), and for (5 + 2√2, 5), it's (5, 5 + 2√2).

5. **Unfolding and marking all locations**: When unfolded, both the original hole and its reflection appear on the paper. So, if the hole was punched at (5 - 2√2, 5), the locations are:
   - (5 - 2√2, 5)
   - (5, 5 - 2√2)
   If at (5 + 2√2, 5), locations are:
   - (5 + 2√2, 5)
   - (5, 5 + 2√2)

   We must check which makes sense with "5 cm from one short edge". In the folded state, if short edge is bottom (y=0), y=5 is consistent. Distance to edge y=0 is y-coordinate, so y=5 means 5 cm from bottom edge. So, possible points are (5 ± 2√2, 5).

   In folded state, distance to fold is 2 cm, which we used. Let's confirm if both points are valid in folded triangle. Typically, folding along diagonal, one half covers the other, so choose the point where it's in the visible folded part, but since it's symmetric, both might be considered. However, problem likely intends one hole punched, reflected by fold.

6. **Final locations**: Since folding reflects over diagonal, punching one hole creates two holes symmetrically over y=x. So, hole locations after unfolding are:
   - If hole at (5 - 2√2, 5), other at (5, 5 - 2√2)
   - If at (5 + 2√2, 5), other at (5, 5 + 2√2)

   Both pairs are symmetric over y=x, and y=5 is 5 cm from bottom edge y=0. Similarly, x=5 is 5 cm from left edge x=0 in the reflected points. Problem says "one short edge", likely bottom or left in folded state, but since it's square, it's symmetric.

   Let's finalize with one interpretation: hole at (5, 5 - 2√2) was punched (5 cm from left edge x=0, since x=5), reflected to (5 - 2√2, 5). Numerically, 5 - 2√2 ≈ 2.172, so points are approximately (5, 2.172) and (2.172, 5), both 5 cm from respective edges (x=0 or y=0).

   If from bottom edge, hole at (5 + 2√2, 5) or (5 - 2√2, 5), but (5, 5 - 2√2) is consistent if we take left edge.

**Final Answer**: After unfolding, the hole locations are at approximately (5, 2.172) and (2.172, 5), or exactly at (5, 5 - 2√2) and (5 - 2√2, 5) in centimeters, assuming the short edge reference is to the left edge in the folded state. If the short edge is interpreted differently, the points could be (5, 5 + 2√2) and (5 + 2√2, 5), but the first pair is likely intended based on standard orientation.
