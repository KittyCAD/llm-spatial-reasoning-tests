# Prompt #30: A 3 cm-wide path runs inside the boundary of a 20 cm × 12 cm rectangle, following the edges like an inner frame. Compute the area of the path and of the remaining central region.

## OpenAI o3
The path is a uniform strip 3 cm wide that runs all the way around the inside of the 20 cm × 12 cm rectangle.

1. Dimensions of the untouched central rectangle  
   Each side is reduced by twice the path’s width (once on each opposite side):
     • Length: 20 cm − 2·3 cm = 14 cm  
     • Width:  12 cm − 2·3 cm =  6 cm

2. Area of the central region  
   14 cm × 6 cm = 84 cm²

3. Area of the whole rectangle  
   20 cm × 12 cm = 240 cm²

4. Area of the path (the rectangular “frame”)  
   240 cm² − 84 cm² = 156 cm²

Answer  
• Area of the 3 cm-wide path: 156 cm²  
• Area of the remaining central region: 84 cm²

## Claude 4 Sonnet
I need to find the area of the path and the area of the central region inside a 20 cm × 12 cm rectangle with a 3 cm-wide path around the inside.

Given information:
- Outer rectangle dimensions: 20 cm × 12 cm
- Path width: 3 cm (runs along the inside of the rectangle)

First, I'll find the dimensions of the inner rectangle (the central region).

Since the path is 3 cm wide on all sides:
- The inner rectangle's length = 20 - 2(3) = 20 - 6 = 14 cm
- The inner rectangle's width = 12 - 2(3) = 12 - 6 = 6 cm

Now I can calculate the areas:

Area of the outer rectangle:
Area = 20 × 12 = 240 cm²

Area of the inner rectangle (central region):
Area = 14 × 6 = 84 cm²

Area of the path:
Area of path = Area of outer rectangle - Area of inner rectangle
Area of path = 240 - 84 = 156 cm²

Therefore:
- The area of the path is 156 cm²
- The area of the remaining central region is 84 cm²

Let the outer rectangle have length L = 20 cm and width W = 12 cm.
The area of this outer rectangle is A_outer = L × W.
A_outer = 20 cm × 12 cm = 240 cm².

A path of width w_path = 3 cm runs inside the boundary of this rectangle. This path creates an inner rectangle, which is the central region.
The path reduces the length and width of the outer rectangle from both sides.
So, the length of the inner rectangle (L_inner) is L - 2 × w_path.
L_inner = 20 cm - 2 × 3 cm = 20 cm - 6 cm = 14 cm.

The width of the inner rectangle (W_inner) is W - 2 × w_path.
W_inner = 12 cm - 2 × 3 cm = 12 cm - 6 cm = 6 cm.

The area of the inner rectangle, which is the remaining central region, is A_inner = L_inner × W_inner.
A_inner = 14 cm × 6 cm = 84 cm².

The area of the path (A_path) is the difference between the area of the outer rectangle and the area of the inner rectangle.
A_path = A_outer - A_inner.
A_path = 240 cm² - 84 cm².
A_path = 156 cm².

To verify the area of the path, we can also calculate it by summing the areas of its parts:
The path can be thought of as four rectangular strips:
1. Two strips along the length of the outer rectangle: these have dimensions L × w_path each. So, 2 × (20 cm × 3 cm) = 2 × 60 cm² = 120 cm².
2. Two strips along the width of the outer rectangle, but with their lengths reduced to fit between the first two strips. Their length will be W - 2 × w_path (the width of the inner rectangle). So, these strips have dimensions (W - 2 × w_path) × w_path each.
(12 cm - 2 × 3 cm) × 3 cm = (12 cm - 6 cm) × 3 cm = 6 cm × 3 cm = 18 cm².
There are two such strips, so 2 × 18 cm² = 36 cm².
The total area of the path is the sum of these parts: 120 cm² + 36 cm² = 156 cm².
This confirms the previous calculation.

The problem asks for two values:
1.  The area of the path.
2.  The area of the remaining central region.

Area of the central region = A_inner = 84 cm².
Area of the path = A_path = 156 cm².

Final Answer:
The area of the remaining central region is 84 cm².
The area of the path is 156 cm².

The rectangle has dimensions 20 cm by 12 cm, so its area is \(20 \times 12 = 240  \text{cm}^2\).

The 3 cm-wide path runs inside the boundary, forming an inner frame. The inner rectangle, which is the central region, has dimensions reduced by twice the path width on each side:
- Length of central region: \(20 - 2 \times 3 = 20 - 6 = 14  \text{cm}\)
- Width of central region: \(12 - 2 \times 3 = 12 - 6 = 6  \text{cm}\)

The area of the central region is \(14 \times 6 = 84  \text{cm}^2\).

The area of the path is the difference between the area of the outer rectangle and the area of the central region:
\[
240  \text{cm}^2 - 84  \text{cm}^2 = 156  \text{cm}^2
\]

Alternatively, the path area can be calculated by considering the four strips:
- Two horizontal strips (top and bottom): Each is 20 cm long and 3 cm wide, so area is \(2 \times (20 \times 3) = 2 \times 60 = 120  \text{cm}^2\).
- Two vertical strips (left and right): The height of each is reduced by the path width at top and bottom, so height is \(12 - 2 \times 3 = 6  \text{cm}\), and width is 3 cm. Thus, area is \(2 \times (6 \times 3) = 2 \times 18 = 36  \text{cm}^2\).
- Total path area: \(120  \text{cm}^2 + 36  \text{cm}^2 = 156  \text{cm}^2\).

Both methods confirm the areas.

Thus, the area of the path is \(156  \text{cm}^2\) and the area of the remaining central region is \(84  \text{cm}^2\).

\[
\boxed{156}  \text{ cm}^2 \quad \text{and} \quad \boxed{84}  \text{ cm}^2
\]

## Grok 3
Let's solve this step by step by visualizing the rectangle and the path inside it.

### Step 1: Understand the problem
We have a rectangle with dimensions 20 cm (length) and 12 cm (width). A 3 cm-wide path runs inside the boundary of this rectangle, following the edges, forming an inner frame. We need to calculate:
1. The area of the path (the frame-like region).
2. The area of the remaining central region (the inner rectangle that is not part of the path).

### Step 2: Visualize the setup
- The outer rectangle is 20 cm by 12 cm.
- The path is 3 cm wide and runs along the inside of the boundary, so it forms a smaller rectangle inside the original one.
- Since the path is 3 cm wide on all sides, the dimensions of the inner rectangle (the central region) will be reduced by twice the width of the path (because the path borders both sides of each dimension).

### Step 3: Calculate the dimensions of the central region
- Original length = 20 cm. The path reduces the length by 3 cm on each side, so:
  Inner length = 20 cm - (2 × 3 cm) = 20 cm - 6 cm = 14 cm.
- Original width = 12 cm. The path reduces the width by 3 cm on each side, so:
  Inner width = 12 cm - (2 × 3 cm) = 12 cm - 6 cm = 6 cm.
- Thus, the central region is a rectangle of dimensions 14 cm by 6 cm.

### Step 4: Calculate the area of the central region
Area of the central region = length × width = 14 cm × 6 cm = 84 cm².

### Step 5: Calculate the area of the original rectangle
Area of the original rectangle = length × width = 20 cm × 12 cm = 240 cm².

### Step 6: Calculate the area of the path
The path's area is the difference between the area of the original rectangle and the area of the central region.
Area of the path = Area of original rectangle - Area of central region = 240 cm² - 84 cm² = 156 cm².

### Step 7: Alternative way to confirm the path's area (optional)
We can think of the path as consisting of four strips (two along the length and two along the width) and account for the overlapping corners:
- Two horizontal strips (along the length): Each is 20 cm long and 3 cm wide, so area = 2 × (20 cm × 3 cm) = 120 cm².
- Two vertical strips (along the width): Each is 12 cm long and 3 cm wide, so area = 2 × (12 cm × 3 cm) = 72 cm².
- However, the corners are counted twice (once in horizontal and once in vertical strips). Each corner is a 3 cm × 3 cm square, and there are 4 corners, so overlapping area = 4 × (3 cm × 3 cm) = 36 cm².
- Total path area = (120 cm² + 72 cm²) - 36 cm² = 192 cm² - 36 cm² = 156 cm².
This matches our earlier calculation, confirming the result.

### Final Answer:
- Area of the path = 156 cm².
- Area of the remaining central region = 84 cm².
