# Prompt #31: Two discs of radius 4 cm have centers 6 cm apart. Find the area of their intersection (the lens) to the nearest tenth of a square cm.

## OpenAI o3
Let  

 r = radius of each circle = 4 cm  
 d = distance between centers = 6 cm

Because d < 2r, the circles overlap.  Join the centers and drop perpendiculars to the common chord:

1.  Let θ be the half–angle subtended by the chord in either circle.  
    cos θ = (d/2)/r = 6/8 = 0.75 ⇒ θ = arccos 0.75 ≈ 0.722734 rad.

2.  Area of the circular segment in one circle  
    = area of the sector − area of the isosceles triangle  
    = r²θ − ½r²sin(2θ).

   Compute sin(2θ): sin(2θ) = 2 sin θ cos θ  
  sin θ = √(1 − 0.75²) = √(1 − 0.5625) = √0.4375 = 0.661438  
  sin(2θ) = 2(0.661438)(0.75) = 0.992158

   Segment area = 4²·0.722734 − ½·4²·0.992158  
      = 16(0.722734 − 0.496079)  
      = 16(0.226655) ≈ 3.626494 cm².

3.  The lens consists of two identical segments, so

 Intersection area = 2(3.626494) ≈ 7.252988 cm².

Rounded to the nearest tenth:

 Area ≈ 7.3 cm².

I need to find the area of intersection of two circles of radius 4 cm whose centers are 6 cm apart.

Let me place the centers at points A = (-3, 0) and B = (3, 0), so they're 6 cm apart on the x-axis.

Both circles have radius r = 4 cm.
- Circle A: (x + 3)² + y² = 16
- Circle B: (x - 3)² + y² = 16

First, I'll find the intersection points. Setting the equations equal:
(x + 3)² + y² = (x - 3)² + y²

Expanding:
x² + 6x + 9 + y² = x² - 6x + 9 + y²

This simplifies to:
12x = 0
x = 0

Substituting x = 0 into either circle equation:
(0 + 3)² + y² = 16
9 + y² = 16
y² = 7
y = ±√7

So the intersection points are (0, √7) and (0, -√7).

The area of intersection consists of two circular segments. By symmetry, I can find the area of one segment and double it.

For a circular segment, I need:
1. The central angle θ of the sector
2. The area = (1/2)r²(θ - sin θ)

To find the angle, I'll use the triangle formed by:
- Center A at (-3, 0)
- Center B at (3, 0)  
- Intersection point at (0, √7)

From center A to the intersection point:
- Horizontal distance: 0 - (-3) = 3
- Vertical distance: √7 - 0 = √7
- cos(θ/2) = 3/4 (adjacent/hypotenuse)

Therefore:
θ/2 = arccos(3/4)
θ = 2 arccos(3/4)

Now I can calculate the area of one segment:
Area of one segment = (1/2) × 4² × (θ - sin θ)
                    = 8(θ - sin θ)

Where:
- θ = 2 arccos(3/4) ≈ 1.3181 radians
- sin θ = sin(2 arccos(3/4)) = 2 × (3/4) × (√7/4) = 3√7/8

Area of one segment = 8(1.3181 - 3√7/8)
                    = 8 × 1.3181 - 3√7
                    = 10.545 - 7.937
                    = 2.608

Total area of intersection = 2 × 2.608 = 5.216

To the nearest tenth: **5.2 square cm**

Let the two discs be $D_1$ and $D_2$. Let their centers be $C_1$ and $C_2$, and their radii be $r_1$ and $r_2$.
We are given that $r_1 = r_2 = r = 4$ cm.
The distance between their centers is $d = 6$ cm.

We can place the centers of the circles on the x-axis. Let $C_1 = (-d/2, 0) = (-3, 0)$ and $C_2 = (d/2, 0) = (3, 0)$.
The equations of the two circles are:
$C_1: (x+3)^2 + y^2 = 4^2 = 16$
$C_2: (x-3)^2 + y^2 = 4^2 = 16$

The area of intersection is a lens shape. Since the radii are equal, the lens is symmetrical about the y-axis. The area of this lens is the sum of two identical circular segments.
First, let's find the intersection points of the two circles.
$(x+3)^2 + y^2 = (x-3)^2 + y^2$
$x^2 + 6x + 9 = x^2 - 6x + 9$
$12x = 0 \implies x = 0$.
Substitute $x=0$ into the equation for $C_1$:
$(0+3)^2 + y^2 = 16$
$9 + y^2 = 16$
$y^2 = 7 \implies y = \pm\sqrt{7}$.
Let the intersection points be $A = (0, \sqrt{7})$ and $B = (0, -\sqrt{7})$.
The line segment $AB$ is the common chord of the two circles. The length of this chord is $2\sqrt{7}$.

The area of the lens is twice the area of one circular segment. Let's calculate the area of the segment of $D_1$ cut by the chord $AB$.
The area of a circular segment is the area of the circular sector minus the area of the triangle formed by the center and the chord.
Let $M$ be the midpoint of the chord $AB$. $M = (0,0)$.
The distance of the chord from $C_1$ is $C_1M = \sqrt{(0 - (-3))^2 + (0-0)^2} = 3$.
The radius of $D_1$ is $r=4$.
Let $\theta$ be the angle $\angle AC_1M$. In triangle $AC_1M$, $C_1M=3$, $AC_1=r=4$, and $AM=\sqrt{7}$.
$\cos \theta = \frac{C_1M}{AC_1} = \frac{3}{4}$.
So, $\theta = \arccos(3/4)$. This angle must be in radians to use the sector area formula $A_{sector} = \frac{1}{2}r^2(2\theta)$.
The angle of the sector $AC_1B$ is $2\theta = 2 \arccos(3/4)$.
The area of sector $AC_1B$ is $A_{sector} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 (2\theta) = r^2 \theta = 4^2 \arccos(3/4) = 16 \arccos(3/4)$.

The area of triangle $AC_1B$ is $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base } AB \times \text{height } C_1M$.
The length of base $AB$ is $2\sqrt{7}$. The height $C_1M$ is $3$.
$A_{triangle} = \frac{1}{2} (2\sqrt{7}) (3) = 3\sqrt{7}$.
Alternatively, using $r$ and $\theta$: $A_{triangle} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \sin(2\theta) = \frac{1}{2} r^2 (2\sin\theta\cos\theta) = r^2 \sin\theta\cos\theta$.
We have $\cos\theta = 3/4$. Then $\sin\theta = \sqrt{1 - (3/4)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 9/16} = \sqrt{7/16} = \sqrt{7}/4$.
So $A_{triangle} = 4^2 (\sqrt{7}/4)(3/4) = 16 (3\sqrt{7}/16) = 3\sqrt{7}$. This matches.

The area of one circular segment $A_{segment}$ is $A_{sector} - A_{triangle}$.
$A_{segment} = 16 \arccos(3/4) - 3\sqrt{7}$.
Since the lens is formed by two identical segments (one from $D_1$ and one from $D_2$), the total area of intersection $A_{lens}$ is $2 \times A_{segment}$.
$A_{lens} = 2 (16 \arccos(3/4) - 3\sqrt{7}) = 32 \arccos(3/4) - 6\sqrt{7}$.

Now, we calculate the numerical value:
$\theta = \arccos(3/4)$. Using a calculator, $\theta \approx 0.7227342478$ radians.
$\sqrt{7} \approx 2.645751311$.
$A_{lens} = 32 \times (0.7227342478) - 6 \times (2.645751311)$
$A_{lens} \approx 23.1274959296 - 15.874507866$
$A_{lens} \approx 7.2529880636$.

We need to round this to the nearest tenth of a square cm.
The first decimal digit is 2. The second decimal digit is 5.
Since the second decimal digit is 5, we round up the first decimal digit.
$A_{lens} \approx 7.3$ cm$^2$.

This method can be confirmed using a common formula for the area of intersection of two circles with radii $r_1, r_2$ and distance $d$ between centers. When $r_1=r_2=r$, the formula simplifies to:
$A = 2r^2 \arccos\left(\frac{d}{2r}\right) - \frac{d}{2}\sqrt{4r^2-d^2}$.
Given $r=4$ and $d=6$:
$A = 2(4^2) \arccos\left(\frac{6}{2 \times 4}\right) - \frac{6}{2}\sqrt{4(4^2)-6^2}$
$A = 32 \arccos\left(\frac{6}{8}\right) - 3\sqrt{4(16)-36}$
$A = 32 \arccos(3/4) - 3\sqrt{64-36}$
$A = 32 \arccos(3/4) - 3\sqrt{28}$
$A = 32 \arccos(3/4) - 3\sqrt{4 \times 7}$
$A = 32 \arccos(3/4) - 3 \times 2\sqrt{7}$
$A = 32 \arccos(3/4) - 6\sqrt{7}$.
This is the same formula derived earlier, confirming the approach. The numerical calculation remains the same.

Final calculation check:
Using Python's math library for higher precision:
`math.acos(0.75)` is $0.7227342478134157$
`32 * math.acos(0.75)` is $23.127495930029303$
`math.sqrt(7)` is $2.6457513110645907$
`6 * math.sqrt(7)` is $15.874507866387544$
Area = $23.127495930029303 - 15.874507866387544 = 7.252988063641759$.
Rounding to the nearest tenth: $7.3$ cm$^2$.

The final answer is $\boxed{7.3 \text{ cm}^2}$.

## DeepSeek Reasoner
The two discs each have a radius of 4 cm, and their centers are 6 cm apart. The area of their intersection, which is lens-shaped, can be found using the formula for the area of intersection of two circles of equal radius \(r\) separated by a distance \(d\):

\[
\text{Area} = 2r^2 \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{d}{2r}\right) - \frac{d}{2} \sqrt{4r^2 - d^2}
\]

Substitute \(r = 4\) cm and \(d = 6\) cm:

\[
\frac{d}{2r} = \frac{6}{8} = 0.75
\]

\[
\cos^{-1}(0.75) \approx 0.722734 \text{ radians}
\]

\[
\sqrt{4r^2 - d^2} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 16 - 36} = \sqrt{64 - 36} = \sqrt{28} = 2\sqrt{7} \approx 5.291502622
\]

Now compute the area:

\[
2 \cdot 4^2 \cdot 0.722734 = 2 \cdot 16 \cdot 0.722734 = 32 \cdot 0.722734 = 23.127488
\]

\[
\frac{d}{2} \cdot 2\sqrt{7} = \frac{6}{2} \cdot 2\sqrt{7} = 3 \cdot 2\sqrt{7} = 6\sqrt{7} \approx 6 \cdot 2.645751311 = 15.874507866
\]

\[
\text{Area} = 23.127488 - 15.874507866 = 7.252980134
\]

Rounded to the nearest tenth, the area is 7.3 cm². The value 7.252980134 is closer to 7.3 than to 7.2, as \(7.3 - 7.252980134 = 0.047019866\) and \(7.252980134 - 7.2 = 0.052980134\), and \(0.047019866 < 0.052980134\).

\boxed{7.3}

## Grok 3
To find the area of the intersection (often called the "lens") of two discs with radius 4 cm and centers 6 cm apart, we can use the formula for the area of intersection of two circles. Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Geometry
- We have two circles, each with radius \( r = 4 \, \text{cm} \).
- The distance between their centers is \( d = 6 \, \text{cm} \).
- Since \( d = 6 \, \text{cm} \) is less than the sum of the radii (\( 4 + 4 = 8 \, \text{cm} \)) and greater than the difference of the radii (\( 4 - 4 = 0 \, \text{cm} \)), the circles intersect at two points, forming a lens-shaped region.
- The area of intersection can be calculated using a formula that involves the central angles subtended by the intersection points in each circle.

### Step 2: Use the Formula for the Area of Intersection
The area of intersection of two circles with radii \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \) (in this case, \( r_1 = r_2 = r = 4 \, \text{cm} \)) and distance \( d = 6 \, \text{cm} \) between their centers is given by:

\[
\text{Area} = r^2 \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{d^2 + r^2 - r^2}{2dr}\right) + r^2 \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{d^2 + r^2 - r^2}{2dr}\right) - \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{(-d + r + r)(d + r - r)(d - r + r)(d + r + r)}
\]

Since the radii are equal (\( r_1 = r_2 = r \)), the formula simplifies to:

\[
\text{Area} = 2 r^2 \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{d}{2r}\right) - \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{(2r - d)(2r + d)(2r)^2}
\]

However, a more straightforward version is:

\[
\text{Area} = 2 r^2 \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{d}{2r}\right) - \frac{d}{2} \sqrt{4r^2 - d^2}
\]

### Step 3: Plug in the Values
- \( r = 4 \, \text{cm} \)
- \( d = 6 \, \text{cm} \)
- Compute \( \frac{d}{2r} = \frac{6}{2 \cdot 4} = \frac{6}{8} = 0.75 \)
- Compute \( \cos^{-1}(0.75) \). Using a calculator, \( \cos^{-1}(0.75) \approx 41.4096^\circ \), or in radians, approximately \( 0.7227 \, \text{radians} \).
- Compute the second term: \( \sqrt{4r^2 - d^2} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 4^2 - 6^2} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 16 - 36} = \sqrt{64 - 36} = \sqrt{28} = 2\sqrt{7} \approx 5.2915 \, \text{cm} \)

Now calculate the area:

\[
\text{Area} = 2 \cdot (4)^2 \cdot \cos^{-1}(0.75) - \frac{6}{2} \cdot 2\sqrt{7}
\]

\[
= 2 \cdot 16 \cdot 0.7227 - 3 \cdot 5.2915
\]

\[
= 32 \cdot 0.7227 - 15.8745
\]

\[
\approx 23.1264 - 15.8745
\]

\[
\approx 7.2519 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

### Step 4: Round to the Nearest Tenth
The calculated area is approximately \( 7.2519 \, \text{cm}^2 \). Rounding to the nearest tenth:

- The digit in the tenths place is 2.
- The digit in the hundredths place is 5, which means we round up.

Thus, \( 7.2519 \approx 7.3 \, \text{cm}^2 \).

### Step 5: Verify the Calculation
I notice that the area seems a bit low for the given dimensions. Let me double-check using the exact formula to avoid rounding errors early on.

Recompute using exact values where possible:

- \( \cos^{-1}(0.75) = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{3}{4}\right) \). This is an angle whose cosine is \( \frac{3}{4} \).
- The exact area formula is:

\[
\text{Area} = 2 r^2 \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{d}{2r}\right) - \frac{d}{2} \sqrt{4r^2 - d^2}
\]

\[
= 2 \cdot 16 \cdot \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{6}{8}\right) - 3 \cdot \sqrt{4 \cdot 16 - 36}
\]

\[
= 32 \cdot \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{3}{4}\right) - 3 \cdot \sqrt{28}
\]

\[
= 32 \cdot \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{3}{4}\right) - 3 \cdot 2\sqrt{7}
\]

\[
= 32 \cdot \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{3}{4}\right) - 6\sqrt{7}
\]

Using a calculator for precision:

- \( \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{3}{4}\right) \approx 0.7227342478 \, \text{radians} \)
- \( 32 \cdot 0.7227342478 \approx 23.12749593 \)
- \( \sqrt{7} \approx 2.645751311 \)
- \( 6 \cdot 2.645751311 \approx 15.87450787 \)
- \( 23.12749593 - 15.87450787 \approx 7.25298806 \)

So, the area is approximately \( 7.253 \, \text{cm}^2 \), which still rounds to \( 7.3 \, \text{cm}^2 \).

### Final Answer
The area of the intersection of the two discs, rounded to the nearest tenth of a square centimeter, is:

\[
\boxed{7.3}
\]
