# Prompt #32: A triangle has vertices (0, 0), (8, 0), and (3, 6). Find the coordinates of its centroid and the equation of the median from the vertex (3, 6).

## OpenAI o3
The centroid G of a triangle is the average of the coordinates of its three vertices.

Vertices:  
A(0, 0), B(8, 0), C(3, 6)

Centroid:
x-coordinate = (0 + 8 + 3)/3 = 11/3  
y-coordinate = (0 + 0 + 6)/3 = 2  

G = (11/3, 2)

--------------------------------------------------
Median from vertex C(3, 6)

1. Midpoint M of the opposite side AB:
   M = ((0 + 8)/2, (0 + 0)/2) = (4, 0)

2. Line through C(3, 6) and M(4, 0):

## Claude 4 Sonnet
I need to find the centroid of the triangle and the equation of the median from vertex (3, 6).

**Step 1: Find the centroid**

The centroid of a triangle is located at the average of the coordinates of its three vertices.

Given vertices:
- A = (0, 0)
- B = (8, 0)
- C = (3, 6)

The centroid G has coordinates:
$$G = \left(\frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3}{3}, \frac{y_1 + y_2 + y_3}{3}\right)$$

$$G = \left(\frac{0 + 8 + 3}{3}, \frac{0 + 0 + 6}{3}\right)$$

$$G = \left(\frac{11}{3}, 2\right)$$

**Step 2: Find the equation of the median from vertex (3, 6)**

A median is a line segment from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.

The vertex is C = (3, 6), so I need to find the midpoint of the opposite side AB.

Midpoint of AB:
$$M = \left(\frac{0 + 8}{2}, \frac{0 + 0}{2}\right) = (4, 0)$$

Now I need the equation of the line passing through C(3, 6) and M(4, 0).

First, find the slope:
$$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{0 - 6}{4 - 3} = \frac{-6}{1} = -6$$

Using point-slope form with point M(4, 0):
$$y - 0 = -6(x - 4)$$
$$y = -6x + 24$$

Therefore:
- The centroid is at $\left(\frac{11}{3}, 2\right)$
- The equation of the median from vertex (3, 6) is $y = -6x + 24$

## Gemini Pro
Let the vertices of the triangle be A = (0, 0), B = (8, 0), and C = (3, 6).

**1. Coordinates of the Centroid**

The coordinates of the centroid (Gx, Gy) of a triangle with vertices (x₁, y₁), (x₂, y₂), and (x₃, y₃) are given by the formula:
Gx = (x₁ + x₂ + x₃) / 3
Gy = (y₁ + y₂ + y₃) / 3

Using the given vertices:
x₁ = 0, y₁ = 0
x₂ = 8, y₂ = 0
x₃ = 3, y₃ = 6

Gx = (0 + 8 + 3) / 3 = 11 / 3
Gy = (0 + 0 + 6) / 3 = 6 / 3 = 2

So, the coordinates of the centroid are **(11/3, 2)**.

**2. Equation of the Median from the Vertex (3, 6)**

The median from a vertex connects that vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.
The vertex is C = (3, 6).
The opposite side is the segment AB, with A = (0, 0) and B = (8, 0).

First, find the midpoint M of the side AB:
M_x = (x_A + x_B) / 2 = (0 + 8) / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4
M_y = (y_A + y_B) / 2 = (0 + 0) / 2 = 0 / 2 = 0
So, the midpoint M is (4, 0).

Now, we need to find the equation of the line passing through the vertex C = (3, 6) and the midpoint M = (4, 0).

Calculate the slope (m) of the median CM:
m = (y_M - y_C) / (x_M - x_C) = (0 - 6) / (4 - 3) = -6 / 1 = -6

Using the point-slope form of a linear equation, y - y₁ = m(x - x₁), with point C(3, 6) and slope m = -6:
y - 6 = -6(x - 3)
y - 6 = -6x + 18
y = -6x + 18 + 6
y = -6x + 24

Alternatively, in standard form Ax + By = C:
6x + y = 24

So, the equation of the median from the vertex (3, 6) is **y = -6x + 24** (or 6x + y = 24).

Summary:
*   The coordinates of the centroid are **(11/3, 2)**.
*   The equation of the median from the vertex (3, 6) is **y = -6x + 24**.

## DeepSeek Reasoner
The vertices of the triangle are \(A(0, 0)\), \(B(8, 0)\), and \(C(3, 6)\).

### Centroid
The centroid \(G\) of a triangle is the average of the coordinates of its vertices.  
\[
G_x = \frac{x_A + x_B + x_C}{3} = \frac{0 + 8 + 3}{3} = \frac{11}{3}
\]  
\[
G_y = \frac{y_A + y_B + y_C}{3} = \frac{0 + 0 + 6}{3} = 2
\]  
Thus, the centroid is at \(\left( \frac{11}{3}, 2 \right)\).

### Median from Vertex (3, 6)
The median from vertex \(C(3, 6)\) is the line segment joining \(C\) to the midpoint of the opposite side, which is side \(AB\) between \(A(0, 0)\) and \(B(8, 0)\).

The midpoint \(M\) of \(AB\) is:  
\[
M_x = \frac{x_A + x_B}{2} = \frac{0 + 8}{2} = 4
\]  
\[
M_y = \frac{y_A + y_B}{2} = \frac{0 + 0}{2} = 0
\]  
So, \(M(4, 0)\).

The median is the line passing through \(C(3, 6)\) and \(M(4, 0)\).  
The slope \(m\) is:  
\[
m = \frac{y_M - y_C}{x_M - x_C} = \frac{0 - 6}{4 - 3} = \frac{-6}{1} = -6
\]  

Using the point-slope form with point \(C(3, 6)\):  
\[
y - 6 = -6(x - 3)
\]  
Simplifying:  
\[
y - 6 = -6x + 18
\]  
\[
y = -6x + 18 + 6
\]  
\[
y = -6x + 24
\]  

Thus, the equation of the median is \(y = -6x + 24\).

### Verification
The centroid \(\left( \frac{11}{3}, 2 \right)\) lies on the median:  
Substitute \(x = \frac{11}{3}\):  
\[
y = -6 \left( \frac{11}{3} \right) + 24 = -22 + 24 = 2
\]  
This matches the \(y\)-coordinate of the centroid, confirming that the median passes through the centroid, as expected.

### Final Answer
- Centroid: \(\left( \dfrac{11}{3}, 2 \right)\)  
- Equation of median from (3, 6): \(y = -6x + 24\)

\[
\boxed{\left( \dfrac{11}{3},\ 2 \right)}
\]
\[
\boxed{y = -6x + 24}
\]

## Grok 3
Let's solve this problem step by step. We have a triangle with vertices at (0, 0), (8, 0), and (3, 6). We need to find the coordinates of its centroid and the equation of the median from the vertex (3, 6).

### Step 1: Find the Coordinates of the Centroid
The centroid of a triangle is the point where its three medians intersect. It is also the average of the coordinates of the three vertices. For a triangle with vertices at \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\), the coordinates of the centroid \((x, y)\) are given by:

\[
x = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3}{3}, \quad y = \frac{y_1 + y_2 + y_3}{3}
\]

Let's plug in the coordinates of the vertices:
- \((x_1, y_1) = (0, 0)\)
- \((x_2, y_2) = (8, 0)\)
- \((x_3, y_3) = (3, 6)\)

Calculate the x-coordinate of the centroid:
\[
x = \frac{0 + 8 + 3}{3} = \frac{11}{3}
\]

Calculate the y-coordinate of the centroid:
\[
y = \frac{0 + 0 + 6}{3} = \frac{6}{3} = 2
\]

So, the coordinates of the centroid are \(\left(\frac{11}{3}, 2\right)\).

### Step 2: Find the Equation of the Median from Vertex (3, 6)
A median of a triangle is a line segment joining a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. We need the median from the vertex (3, 6) to the midpoint of the side joining (0, 0) and (8, 0).

First, find the midpoint of the side joining (0, 0) and (8, 0). The midpoint \((x_m, y_m)\) of a line segment with endpoints \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is:

\[
x_m = \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \quad y_m = \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}
\]

Plugging in the coordinates:
\[
x_m = \frac{0 + 8}{2} = 4, \quad y_m = \frac{0 + 0}{2} = 0
\]

So, the midpoint is (4, 0).

Now, we need the equation of the line passing through the points (3, 6) and (4, 0). The slope \(m\) of a line passing through two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is:

\[
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\]

Using the points (3, 6) and (4, 0):
\[
m = \frac{0 - 6}{4 - 3} = \frac{-6}{1} = -6
\]

The slope of the median is -6. Now, use the point-slope form of the equation of a line, \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\), with the point (3, 6):

\[
y - 6 = -6(x - 3)
\]

Simplify to get the equation in slope-intercept form:
\[
y - 6 = -6x + 18
\]
\[
y = -6x + 18 + 6
\]
\[
y = -6x + 24
\]

Alternatively, we can write it in standard form by moving all terms to one side:
\[
6x + y - 24 = 0
\]

Both forms are acceptable, but the slope-intercept form \(y = -6x + 24\) is often more straightforward.

### Final Answer:
- The coordinates of the centroid are \(\left(\frac{11}{3}, 2\right)\).
- The equation of the median from the vertex (3, 6) is \(y = -6x + 24\) (or \(6x + y - 24 = 0\)).
