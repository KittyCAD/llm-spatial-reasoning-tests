# Prompt #34: I have a 4-dimensional point (x, y, z, i) at (2, -5, 10, 3). Rotate this point 90 degrees about the z axis.

## OpenAI o3  (12 secs)
A rotation of 90° about the z–axis only affects the x- and y-coordinates; z and the fourth coordinate i stay the same.

For θ = 90°:
 x′ = x cos θ − y sin θ = 0·x − 1·y = −y  
 y′ = x sin θ + y cos θ = 1·x + 0·y =  x

Starting point: (x, y, z, i) = (2, −5, 10, 3)

x′ = −(−5) = 5  
y′ =  2  
z′ = 10  
i′ = 3

Rotated point: (5, 2, 10, 3).

To rotate a 4D point about the z-axis, I need to apply a rotation that affects only the x and y coordinates, while leaving z and i unchanged.

For a 90-degree rotation about the z-axis (counterclockwise when looking down the positive z-axis), the transformation is:
- x' = -y
- y' = x
- z' = z
- i' = i

Given the point (2, -5, 10, 3):
- x' = -(-5) = 5
- y' = 2
- z' = 10
- i' = 3

Therefore, the rotated point is **(5, 2, 10, 3)**.

This can also be represented using a 4×4 rotation matrix:
```
[0  -1  0  0] [2]   [5]
[1   0  0  0] [-5]  [2]
[0   0  1  0] [10] = [10]
[0   0  0  1] [3]   [3]
```

Okay, when we rotate a point about one of the Cartesian axes in higher dimensions, the coordinates corresponding to that axis (and any other axes not involved in the plane of rotation) remain unchanged.

In this case, we are rotating about the z-axis. This means:
1.  The **z-coordinate** will remain the same.
2.  The **i-coordinate** will also remain the same, as the rotation is happening in the xy-plane (or a plane parallel to it, defined by the z-value).

The rotation affects the x and y coordinates. A 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation of a point (x, y) in a 2D plane around the origin results in a new point (x', y') where:
*   x' = x * cos(90°) - y * sin(90°)
*   y' = x * sin(90°) + y * cos(90°)

Since cos(90°) = 0 and sin(90°) = 1:
*   x' = x * (0) - y * (1) = -y
*   y' = x * (1) + y * (0) = x

So, the transformation for (x, y) is (x, y) -> (-y, x).

Let's apply this to your point (x, y, z, i) = (2, -5, 10, 3):

*   Original x = 2
*   Original y = -5
*   Original z = 10
*   Original i = 3

The new coordinates (x', y', z', i') will be:
*   x' = -y = -(-5) = 5
*   y' = x = 2
*   z' = z = 10 (unchanged)
*   i' = i = 3 (unchanged)

So, the new point after a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation about the z-axis is **(5, 2, 10, 3)**.

(Note: If a clockwise rotation was intended, the transformation for (x,y) would be (y, -x), resulting in (-5, -2, 10, 3). By convention, "rotation" usually implies counter-clockwise unless specified otherwise.)

To rotate a point in 4-dimensional space about the z-axis, only the x and y coordinates are affected, while the z and i coordinates remain unchanged. This is analogous to rotating in the xy-plane in 3D space.

The rotation of a point \((x, y)\) by 90 degrees counterclockwise (the standard mathematical direction) in the xy-plane is given by:
- New x-coordinate: \(-y\)
- New y-coordinate: \(x\)

Given the original point \((x, y, z, i) = (2, -5, 10, 3)\):
- New x: \(-(-5) = 5\)
- New y: \(2\)
- z remains \(10\)
- i remains \(3\)

Thus, the rotated point is \((5, 2, 10, 3)\).

This can be confirmed using the rotation matrix for a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation about the z-axis in 4D:
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]
Applying this matrix to the point \((2, -5, 10, 3)\):
- New x: \(0 \cdot 2 + (-1) \cdot (-5) + 0 \cdot 10 + 0 \cdot 3 = 5\)
- New y: \(1 \cdot 2 + 0 \cdot (-5) + 0 \cdot 10 + 0 \cdot 3 = 2\)
- New z: \(0 \cdot 2 + 0 \cdot (-5) + 1 \cdot 10 + 0 \cdot 3 = 10\)
- New i: \(0 \cdot 2 + 0 \cdot (-5) + 0 \cdot 10 + 1 \cdot 3 = 3\)

The result is consistent: \((5, 2, 10, 3)\).

\boxed{(5, 2, 10, 3)}

To rotate a 4-dimensional point about the z-axis by 90 degrees, we need to consider that the rotation will affect only the x and y coordinates, while the z and i coordinates remain unchanged. In 4-dimensional space, the z-axis is one of the spatial axes, and a rotation about it operates in the xy-plane, just as it would in 3-dimensional space.

### Step 1: Understand the rotation in the xy-plane
A 90-degree rotation about the z-axis in the xy-plane transforms the coordinates (x, y) as follows:
- A point (x, y) becomes (-y, x) for a counterclockwise 90-degree rotation.

This can be derived from the 2D rotation matrix for a 90-degree rotation:
\[
R = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos(90^\circ) & -\sin(90^\circ) \\
\sin(90^\circ) & \cos(90^\circ)
\end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix}
0 & -1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\]
Applying this to a point (x, y):
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
x' \\
y'
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
-y \\
x
\end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 2: Apply the rotation to the 4D point
The 4D point is (x, y, z, i) = (2, -5, 10, 3). Since the rotation is about the z-axis, only the x and y coordinates are transformed, while z and i remain the same.
- Original (x, y) = (2, -5)
- After 90-degree rotation: (x', y') = (-y, x) = (-(-5), 2) = (5, 2)
- z remains 10
- i remains 3

Thus, the new coordinates are (5, 2, 10, 3).

### Final Answer:
The rotated point is **(5, 2, 10, 3)**.
