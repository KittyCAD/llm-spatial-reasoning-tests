# Prompt #35: In ℝ⁴ the points A (1, −2, 4, 0) and B (−3, 6, 1, 5) are given. What is the Euclidean distance between A and B (exact value, not decimal)?

## OpenAI o3  (5 secs)
The Euclidean distance is obtained from the length of the difference vector A − B:

Δx = 1 − (−3) = 4  
Δy = −2 − 6 = −8  
Δz = 4 − 1 = 3  
Δw = 0 − 5 = −5  

Distance = √[(4)² + (−8)² + (3)² + (−5)²]  
      = √[16 + 64 + 9 + 25]  
      = √114  

Since 114 has no square factors, the exact distance is √114.

To find the Euclidean distance between two points in ℝ⁴, I'll use the distance formula:

For points A = (a₁, a₂, a₃, a₄) and B = (b₁, b₂, b₃, b₄), the distance is:
d(A,B) = √[(b₁-a₁)² + (b₂-a₂)² + (b₃-a₃)² + (b₄-a₄)²]

Given:
- A = (1, -2, 4, 0)
- B = (-3, 6, 1, 5)

Let me calculate each component:
- b₁ - a₁ = -3 - 1 = -4
- b₂ - a₂ = 6 - (-2) = 6 + 2 = 8
- b₃ - a₃ = 1 - 4 = -3
- b₄ - a₄ = 5 - 0 = 5

Now I'll square each difference:
- (-4)² = 16
- 8² = 64
- (-3)² = 9
- 5² = 25

Sum of squares:
16 + 64 + 9 + 25 = 114

Therefore, the Euclidean distance is:
d(A,B) = √114

Since 114 = 2 × 3 × 19, and none of these prime factors appear in pairs, √114 cannot be simplified further.

The exact distance between A and B is **√114**.

Let A = (x₁, y₁, z₁, w₁) and B = (x₂, y₂, z₂, w₂) be two points in ℝ⁴.
The Euclidean distance between A and B is given by the formula:
d(A, B) = √((x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)² + (z₂ - z₁)² + (w₂ - w₁)²).

Given the points A (1, −2, 4, 0) and B (−3, 6, 1, 5).
We have:
x₁ = 1, y₁ = -2, z₁ = 4, w₁ = 0
x₂ = -3, y₂ = 6, z₂ = 1, w₂ = 5

Now we calculate the differences in each coordinate:
Δx = x₂ - x₁ = -3 - 1 = -4
Δy = y₂ - y₁ = 6 - (-2) = 6 + 2 = 8
Δz = z₂ - z₁ = 1 - 4 = -3
Δw = w₂ - w₁ = 5 - 0 = 5

Next, we square these differences:
(Δx)² = (-4)² = 16
(Δy)² = (8)² = 64
(Δz)² = (-3)² = 9
(Δw)² = (5)² = 25

Now, we sum these squared differences:
Sum of squares = (Δx)² + (Δy)² + (Δz)² + (Δw)² = 16 + 64 + 9 + 25
Sum of squares = 80 + 9 + 25
Sum of squares = 89 + 25
Sum of squares = 114

Finally, we take the square root of the sum of squares to find the Euclidean distance:
d(A, B) = √114

To ensure this is the exact value, we check if √114 can be simplified. We need to find the prime factorization of 114:
114 ÷ 2 = 57
57 ÷ 3 = 19
19 is a prime number.
So, the prime factorization of 114 is 2 × 3 × 19.
Since there are no repeated prime factors, the square root of 114 cannot be simplified further.

Therefore, the exact Euclidean distance between A and B is √114.

The final answer is $\boxed{\sqrt{114}}$.

The Euclidean distance between two points in \(n\)-dimensional space is given by the formula:
\[
\text{distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2 + (w_2 - w_1)^2}
\]
for points \(A(x_1, y_1, z_1, w_1)\) and \(B(x_2, y_2, z_2, w_2)\).

Given \(A(1, -2, 4, 0)\) and \(B(-3, 6, 1, 5)\), compute the differences in each coordinate:
- \(x\)-difference: \(-3 - 1 = -4\)
- \(y\)-difference: \(6 - (-2) = 8\)
- \(z\)-difference: \(1 - 4 = -3\)
- \(w\)-difference: \(5 - 0 = 5\)

Square each difference:
- \((-4)^2 = 16\)
- \(8^2 = 64\)
- \((-3)^2 = 9\)
- \(5^2 = 25\)

Sum the squares:
\[
16 + 64 + 9 + 25 = 114
\]

The distance is the square root of this sum:
\[
\text{distance} = \sqrt{114}
\]

The value \(\sqrt{114}\) is already in simplest radical form, as \(114 = 2 \times 3 \times 19\) has no perfect square factors other than 1.

Thus, the exact Euclidean distance is \(\sqrt{114}\).

\boxed{\sqrt{114}}

To find the Euclidean distance between points A and B in ℝ⁴, we use the formula for the distance between two points in n-dimensional space. For two points \( A(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) \) and \( B(y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4) \), the Euclidean distance \( d \) is given by:

\[
d = \sqrt{(x_1 - y_1)^2 + (x_2 - y_2)^2 + (x_3 - y_3)^2 + (x_4 - y_4)^2}
\]

Here, the coordinates are:
- \( A(1, -2, 4, 0) \)
- \( B(-3, 6, 1, 5) \)

Let's calculate the differences for each coordinate:
- \( x_1 - y_1 = 1 - (-3) = 1 + 3 = 4 \)
- \( x_2 - y_2 = -2 - 6 = -8 \)
- \( x_3 - y_3 = 4 - 1 = 3 \)
- \( x_4 - y_4 = 0 - 5 = -5 \)

Now, square each difference:
- \( 4^2 = 16 \)
- \( (-8)^2 = 64 \)
- \( 3^2 = 9 \)
- \( (-5)^2 = 25 \)

Sum these squared differences:
\[
16 + 64 + 9 + 25 = 114
\]

Finally, take the square root of the sum to find the Euclidean distance:
\[
d = \sqrt{114}
\]

Since 114 cannot be simplified further under the square root (it is not a perfect square and has no perfect square factors other than 1), the exact value of the distance is \( \sqrt{114} \).

**Final Answer: \( \sqrt{114} \)**
