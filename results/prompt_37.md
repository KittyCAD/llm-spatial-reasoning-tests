# Prompt #37: Project the 4-D point (3, −1, 2, 5) orthographically onto the hyperplane  w = 1, then scale the result by ½.  Give the final 3-D coordinates.

## OpenAI o3  (13 secs)
Orthographic projection onto the hyperplane w = 1 just sets the w-coordinate to 1 while leaving x, y, z unchanged:

(3, −1, 2, 5)  ⟶  (3, −1, 2, 1).

Interpreting this as the 3-D point (3, −1, 2) and scaling it by ½ gives

½ · (3, −1, 2) = (1.5, −0.5, 1).

Final 3-D coordinates: (1.5, −0.5, 1).

I need to project the 4D point (3, -1, 2, 5) orthogonally onto the hyperplane w = 1, then scale by 1/2.

First, let me find the orthogonal projection onto the hyperplane w = 1.

The hyperplane w = 1 can be written as all points of the form (x, y, z, 1). The normal vector to this hyperplane is n = (0, 0, 0, 1).

For orthogonal projection of point P = (3, -1, 2, 5) onto the hyperplane w = 1:
- The point P has w-coordinate 5
- The projected point will have w-coordinate 1
- The projection moves parallel to the normal vector n = (0, 0, 0, 1)

The projected point is:
P' = P - (distance to hyperplane) × n
P' = (3, -1, 2, 5) - (5 - 1) × (0, 0, 0, 1)
P' = (3, -1, 2, 5) - 4 × (0, 0, 0, 1)
P' = (3, -1, 2, 5) - (0, 0, 0, 4)
P' = (3, -1, 2, 1)

Now I need to scale this 4D point by 1/2:
Scaled point = 1/2 × (3, -1, 2, 1) = (3/2, -1/2, 1, 1/2)

Since we want the final 3D coordinates, and this is an orthographic projection from 4D to 3D, we drop the w-coordinate:

Final 3D coordinates: (3/2, -1/2, 1) or (1.5, -0.5, 1)

Let the 4-D point be $P = (x, y, z, w)$. In this problem, $P = (3, -1, 2, 5)$.

Step 1: Orthographic projection onto the hyperplane $w=1$.
An orthographic projection maps a point $P$ to a point $P'$ on the hyperplane such that the vector $P - P'$ is orthogonal to the hyperplane.
The hyperplane is given by $w=1$. In $\mathbb{R}^4$, this can be written as $(0,0,0,1) \cdot (x,y,z,w) = 1$. The normal vector to this hyperplane is $n = (0,0,0,1)$.
Let $P=(x_0, y_0, z_0, w_0) = (3,-1,2,5)$. Let the projected point be $P'=(x', y', z', w')$.
Since $P'$ lies on the hyperplane $w=1$, its $w$-coordinate must be $w'=1$.
The vector $P-P'$ must be parallel to the normal vector $n$. So, $P-P' = k n$ for some scalar $k$.
$(x_0-x', y_0-y', z_0-z', w_0-w') = k(0,0,0,1) = (0,0,0,k)$.
This implies:
$x_0-x' = 0 \Rightarrow x' = x_0 = 3$
$y_0-y' = 0 \Rightarrow y' = y_0 = -1$
$z_0-z' = 0 \Rightarrow z' = z_0 = 2$
$w_0-w' = k$. Since $w_0=5$ and $w'=1$, we have $5-1=k$, so $k=4$.
Thus, the orthographically projected point is $P' = (3, -1, 2, 1)$.

Step 2: Scale the result by $1/2$.
"The result" is the point $P'=(3, -1, 2, 1)$. Scaling this point by $1/2$ means multiplying its coordinates by $1/2$. This is equivalent to a homothety (scaling) centered at the origin $(0,0,0,0)$ of $\mathbb{R}^4$.
Let $P''$ be the scaled point.
$P'' = \frac{1}{2} P' = \frac{1}{2} (3, -1, 2, 1) = \left(\frac{1}{2} \cdot 3, \frac{1}{2} \cdot (-1), \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2, \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1\right)$.
$P'' = \left(\frac{3}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}, 1, \frac{1}{2}\right)$.

Step 3: Give the final 3-D coordinates.
The point $P''$ is a 4-D point $(x,y,z,w) = (\frac{3}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}, 1, \frac{1}{2})$.
The "final 3-D coordinates" refers to the $(x,y,z)$ components of this point.
So the final 3-D coordinates are $\left(\frac{3}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}, 1\right)$.

Alternate interpretation for Step 2:
If the scaling by $1/2$ is meant to be a transformation within the hyperplane $w=1$, the center of scaling would typically be the origin of that hyperplane, i.e., $O_H = (0,0,0,1)$.
In this case, the transformation is $X \mapsto O_H + s(X-O_H)$.
The point to be scaled is $P'=(3,-1,2,1)$. The scalar is $s=1/2$.
The vector from $O_H$ to $P'$ is $P'-O_H = (3,-1,2,1) - (0,0,0,1) = (3,-1,2,0)$.
Scale this vector by $1/2$: $\frac{1}{2}(3,-1,2,0) = (\frac{3}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}, 1, 0)$.
Add this scaled vector back to $O_H$: $P''' = O_H + (\frac{3}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}, 1, 0) = (0,0,0,1) + (\frac{3}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}, 1, 0) = (\frac{3}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}, 1, 1)$.
In this case, the final 4-D point is $P''' = (\frac{3}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}, 1, 1)$. This point lies in the hyperplane $w=1$.
The final 3-D coordinates are the $(x,y,z)$ components of $P'''$, which are $\left(\frac{3}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}, 1\right)$.

Both interpretations yield the same 3-D coordinates. The standard interpretation of "scale point X by s" is $sX$, i.e. scaling from the origin of the space the point lives in. $P'$ is a point in $\mathbb{R}^4$. Therefore, the first interpretation is the most direct.

The steps are:
1.  The initial 4-D point is $(3, -1, 2, 5)$.
2.  Orthographic projection onto the hyperplane $w=1$ changes the $w$-coordinate to $1$ and keeps other coordinates the same. So the projected point is $(3, -1, 2, 1)$.
3.  Scaling this result by $1/2$ means multiplying each coordinate by $1/2$:
    $(\frac{1}{2} \cdot 3, \frac{1}{2} \cdot (-1), \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2, \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1) = (\frac{3}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}, 1, \frac{1}{2})$.
4.  The final 3-D coordinates are the first three coordinates of this resulting point: $(\frac{3}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}, 1)$.

The final answer is $\boxed{\left(\frac{3}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}, 1\right)}$.

To project the 4-D point \((3, -1, 2, 5)\) orthographically onto the hyperplane \(w = 1\), find the closest point on the hyperplane. Since the hyperplane \(w = 1\) is defined by setting the \(w\)-coordinate to 1 while keeping the \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\)-coordinates unchanged, the projection is \((3, -1, 2, 1)\).

This point on the hyperplane \(w = 1\) corresponds to the 3-D point \((3, -1, 2)\) in the affine space where \(w = 1\).

Next, scale this result by \(\frac{1}{2}\). Scaling the 3-D coordinates \((3, -1, 2)\) by \(\frac{1}{2}\) means multiplying each coordinate by \(\frac{1}{2}\):

- \(x\)-coordinate: \(3 \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2}\)
- \(y\)-coordinate: \(-1 \times \frac{1}{2} = -\frac{1}{2}\)
- \(z\)-coordinate: \(2 \times \frac{1}{2} = 1\)

Thus, the scaled point is \(\left( \frac{3}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}, 1 \right)\).

The final 3-D coordinates are \(\left( \frac{3}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}, 1 \right)\).

\boxed{\left( \dfrac{3}{2},\ -\dfrac{1}{2},\ 1 \right)}

## Grok 3  (5 secs)
To solve this problem, we will project a 4-D point orthographically onto a hyperplane and then apply a scaling factor to the result. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the 4-D point and the hyperplane
- The 4-D point is given as \((3, -1, 2, 5)\), where the coordinates correspond to \((x, y, z, w)\).
- The hyperplane is defined by \(w = 1\). In 4-D space, this hyperplane is a 3-D subspace where the \(w\)-coordinate is fixed at 1.

### Step 2: Perform orthographic projection onto the hyperplane \(w = 1\)
- Orthographic projection in this context means projecting the point along the \(w\)-axis (i.e., parallel to the \(w\)-direction) onto the hyperplane \(w = 1\).
- For a point \((x, y, z, w)\) in 4-D space, the orthographic projection onto the hyperplane \(w = 1\) simply changes the \(w\)-coordinate to 1, while keeping the other coordinates unchanged.
- Thus, the projection of \((3, -1, 2, 5)\) onto \(w = 1\) is \((3, -1, 2, 1)\).

### Step 3: Discard the \(w\)-coordinate to obtain 3-D coordinates
- Since the result is on the hyperplane \(w = 1\), and we are asked for 3-D coordinates, we can ignore the \(w\)-coordinate (which is now 1) and consider only the first three coordinates.
- The 3-D coordinates after projection are \((3, -1, 2)\).

### Step 4: Scale the 3-D result by \( \frac{1}{2} \)
- Scaling a 3-D point by a factor of \( \frac{1}{2} \) means multiplying each coordinate by \( \frac{1}{2} \).
- So, scaling \((3, -1, 2)\) by \( \frac{1}{2} \) gives:
  \[
  \left(3 \cdot \frac{1}{2}, -1 \cdot \frac{1}{2}, 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{3}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}, 1\right)
  \]

### Final Answer:
The final 3-D coordinates after orthographic projection and scaling are:
\[
\left( \frac{3}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}, 1 \right)
\]
