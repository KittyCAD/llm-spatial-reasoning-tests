# Prompt #39: What is the hyper-volume of a 4-D sphere of radius 7?  Express the answer in terms of π.

## OpenAI o3  (11 secs)
For an \(n\)-dimensional sphere (an \(n\)-ball) of radius \(R\), the hyper-volume is

\[
V_n(R)=\frac{\pi^{\,n/2}}{\Gamma\!\left(\dfrac{n}{2}+1\right)}\,R^{\,n}.
\]

In 4 dimensions (\(n=4\)),

\[
\Gamma\!\left(\frac{4}{2}+1\right)=\Gamma(3)=2,
\]
so

\[
V_4(R)=\frac{\pi^{2}}{2}\,R^{4}.
\]

With \(R = 7\),

\[
V_4(7)=\frac{\pi^{2}}{2}\,(7^{4})
       =\frac{\pi^{2}}{2}\,(2401)
       =\frac{2401}{2}\,\pi^{2}.
\]

Therefore, the hyper-volume of a 4-D sphere of radius 7 is

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{2401}{2}\,\pi^{2}}.

I need to find the hypervolume (4-dimensional volume) of a 4-dimensional sphere (also called a 4-ball) with radius 7.

The general formula for the hypervolume of a 4-dimensional ball of radius r is:

V₄ = (π²/2)r⁴

This can be derived from the general formula for n-dimensional balls, but I'll use this known result for n=4.

Substituting r = 7:

V₄ = (π²/2)(7)⁴
V₄ = (π²/2)(2401)
V₄ = 2401π²/2

Therefore, the hypervolume of a 4-D sphere of radius 7 is **2401π²/2** or **1200.5π²**.

The volume of an n-dimensional hypersphere (or n-ball) of radius R is given by the formula:
V_n(R) = (π^(n/2) / Γ(n/2 + 1)) * R^n
where Γ is the Gamma function.

For a 4-D sphere (n=4) with radius R=7:
n = 4
R = 7

First, let's calculate n/2:
n/2 = 4/2 = 2

So, the formula becomes:
V_4(R) = (π^(4/2) / Γ(4/2 + 1)) * R^4
V_4(R) = (π^2 / Γ(2 + 1)) * R^4
V_4(R) = (π^2 / Γ(3)) * R^4

The Gamma function Γ(n) for positive integers n is (n-1)!.
So, Γ(3) = (3-1)! = 2! = 2 * 1 = 2.

Substitute Γ(3) = 2 into the formula:
V_4(R) = (π^2 / 2) * R^4

Now, substitute the radius R = 7:
V_4(7) = (π^2 / 2) * 7^4

Calculate 7^4:
7^1 = 7
7^2 = 49
7^3 = 49 * 7 = 343
7^4 = 343 * 7 = 2401

Now, substitute 7^4 = 2401 into the volume formula:
V_4(7) = (π^2 / 2) * 2401
V_4(7) = (2401/2) * π^2

So, the hyper-volume is (2401/2)π^2.
This can also be written as 1200.5π^2.

The hyper-volume of a 4-D sphere of radius 7 is **(2401/2)π^2**.

The hyper-volume \(V_4\) of a 4-dimensional sphere of radius \(r\) is given by the formula:

\[
V_4(r) = \frac{\pi^2 r^4}{2}
\]

For a radius of 7, substitute \(r = 7\):

\[
V_4(7) = \frac{\pi^2 (7)^4}{2}
\]

Calculate \(7^4\):

\[
7^2 = 49, \quad 7^4 = 49^2 = 2401
\]

Thus,

\[
V_4(7) = \frac{\pi^2 \cdot 2401}{2} = \frac{2401 \pi^2}{2}
\]

The fraction \(\frac{2401}{2}\) is already simplified, as 2401 and 2 have no common factors other than 1.

Therefore, the hyper-volume of the 4-dimensional sphere of radius 7 is \(\frac{2401 \pi^2}{2}\).

\boxed{\dfrac{2401\pi^{2}}{2}}

To find the hyper-volume of a 4-dimensional sphere (also called a 4-sphere or 4-ball) with a radius of 7, we use the general formula for the volume of an n-dimensional ball. The volume \( V_n \) of an n-dimensional ball of radius \( R \) is given by:

\[
V_n = \frac{\pi^{n/2}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2} + 1\right)} R^n
\]

where \( \Gamma \) is the gamma function, which generalizes the factorial to non-integer values. For a 4-dimensional sphere, \( n = 4 \), and the radius \( R = 7 \). Let's plug these values into the formula.

### Step 1: Compute the exponent of π
Since \( n = 4 \), we have:
\[
\frac{n}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
\]
So,
\[
\pi^{n/2} = \pi^2
\]

### Step 2: Compute the gamma function term
The argument of the gamma function is:
\[
\frac{n}{2} + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3
\]
We know that for positive integers, \( \Gamma(k) = (k-1)! \). Therefore:
\[
\Gamma(3) = 2! = 2
\]

### Step 3: Compute the radius term
The radius \( R = 7 \), and since \( n = 4 \), we have:
\[
R^n = 7^4 = 2401
\]

### Step 4: Combine all terms
Now, substitute these into the formula for the 4-dimensional volume:
\[
V_4 = \frac{\pi^{2}}{\Gamma(3)} \cdot 7^4 = \frac{\pi^2}{2} \cdot 2401
\]

### Step 5: Simplify the expression
Calculate the numerical part:
\[
\frac{2401}{2} = 1200.5
\]
So,
\[
V_4 = 1200.5 \cdot \pi^2
\]

To keep the answer exact, we can express it as:
\[
V_4 = \frac{2401}{2} \pi^2
\]

### Final Answer:
The hyper-volume of a 4-dimensional sphere with radius 7 is:
\[
\frac{2401}{2} \pi^2
\]
