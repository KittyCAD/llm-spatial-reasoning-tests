# Prompt #40: A particle starts at (0, 0, 0, 0) and moves with constant 4-velocity  v = (1, −2, 3, 4) units/second.  Where is it after √3 seconds (exact coordinates)?

## OpenAI o3  (17 secs)
Because the 4-velocity is constant, the particle’s position vector grows linearly with time:

x(t) = x(0) + v t ,
with x(0) = (0,0,0,0) and v = (1, −2, 3, 4).

Hence, after t = √3 s

x(√3) = (0,0,0,0) + (1, −2, 3, 4) √3
       = (√3, −2√3, 3√3, 4√3).

So the exact coordinates are
( √3 , −2√3 , 3√3 , 4√3 ).

I need to find the position of a particle after √3 seconds given its constant 4-velocity.

Given:
- Initial position: (0, 0, 0, 0)
- 4-velocity: v = (1, -2, 3, 4) units/second
- Time elapsed: t = √3 seconds

Since the particle moves with constant 4-velocity, its position after time t is simply:

**Final position = Initial position + (velocity × time)**

For each coordinate:
- x₀ = 0 + 1 × √3 = √3
- x₁ = 0 + (-2) × √3 = -2√3
- x₂ = 0 + 3 × √3 = 3√3
- x₃ = 0 + 4 × √3 = 4√3

Therefore, after √3 seconds, the particle is at position **(√3, -2√3, 3√3, 4√3)**.

Note: I should verify that the given 4-velocity is physically valid. For a massive particle, the 4-velocity should satisfy v·v = -c² (in units where c = 1, this means v·v = -1). Let me check:

v·v = 1² - (-2)² - 3² - 4² = 1 - 4 - 9 - 16 = -28

This is not -1, so this represents either a non-physical 4-velocity or we're working in a different convention/coordinate system. However, the mathematical answer for the position remains **(√3, -2√3, 3√3, 4√3)**.

Let the 4-position of the particle be denoted by x = (x₀, x₁, x₂, x₃).
The initial position is x(0) = (0, 0, 0, 0).
The constant 4-velocity is v = dx/dτ = (dx₀/dτ, dx₁/dτ, dx₂/dτ, dx₃/dτ) = (1, -2, 3, 4) units/second, where τ is the proper time.

Since the 4-velocity is constant, the position after a proper time interval Δτ is given by:
x(Δτ) = x(0) + v * Δτ

Given Δτ = √3 seconds.

So, the new 4-position components are:
x₀(√3) = x₀(0) + v₀ * Δτ = 0 + (1) * √3 = √3
x₁(√3) = x₁(0) + v₁ * Δτ = 0 + (-2) * √3 = -2√3
x₂(√3) = x₂(0) + v₂ * Δτ = 0 + (3) * √3 = 3√3
x₃(√3) = x₃(0) + v₃ * Δτ = 0 + (4) * √3 = 4√3

Therefore, the particle's 4-position after √3 seconds is (√3, -2√3, 3√3, 4√3).

The final answer is $\boxed{(\sqrt{3}, -2\sqrt{3}, 3\sqrt{3}, 4\sqrt{3})}$

The particle starts at the origin of spacetime, (0, 0, 0, 0), and moves with a constant 4-velocity of \( \mathbf{v} = (1, -2, 3, 4) \) units/second. This 4-velocity represents the rate of change of the spacetime coordinates with respect to time, where the first component is the time velocity (\( dt/dt = 1 \)), and the remaining components are the spatial velocities in the x, y, and z directions, respectively.

Given the constant 4-velocity, the position as a function of coordinate time \( t \) (in seconds) is:

- Time coordinate: \( t \)
- x-coordinate: \( v_x \cdot t = -2t \)
- y-coordinate: \( v_y \cdot t = 3t \)
- z-coordinate: \( v_z \cdot t = 4t \)

Thus, the spacetime position at time \( t \) is \( (t, -2t, 3t, 4t) \).

After \( t = \sqrt{3} \) seconds, substitute \( t = \sqrt{3} \):

- Time coordinate: \( \sqrt{3} \)
- x-coordinate: \( -2 \cdot \sqrt{3} = -2\sqrt{3} \)
- y-coordinate: \( 3 \cdot \sqrt{3} = 3\sqrt{3} \)
- z-coordinate: \( 4 \cdot \sqrt{3} = 4\sqrt{3} \)

Therefore, the exact coordinates after \( \sqrt{3} \) seconds are \( (\sqrt{3}, -2\sqrt{3}, 3\sqrt{3}, 4\sqrt{3}) \).

\boxed{\left( \sqrt{3},\ -2\sqrt{3},\ 3\sqrt{3},\ 4\sqrt{3} \right)}

## Grok 3  (34 secs)
To determine the position of the particle after √3 seconds, we need to interpret the given information in the context of special relativity, since a 4-velocity is provided. The 4-velocity is a four-vector in spacetime that describes the rate of change of a particle's position with respect to its proper time (the time experienced by the particle in its rest frame). Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the 4-velocity
The 4-velocity \( v = (v^0, v^1, v^2, v^3) = (1, -2, 3, 4) \) units/second is given in a coordinate system. In special relativity, the 4-velocity is related to the particle's 3-velocity (ordinary velocity in space) and is normalized such that its magnitude is the speed of light \( c \) (in natural units, often \( c = 1 \)). The components are typically expressed as:
- \( v^0 = \gamma c \), the time component (related to the rate of change of coordinate time),
- \( v^i = \gamma \mathbf{v} \), the spatial components (related to the 3-velocity \( \mathbf{v} \)),

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{|\mathbf{v}|^2}{c^2}}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

However, since the problem gives the 4-velocity directly as \( v = (1, -2, 3, 4) \), we can assume it is already in the correct units and normalization for the coordinate system. The magnitude of the 4-velocity should satisfy the Minkowski metric condition (assuming the metric signature is \( (+, -, -, -) \)):
\[ (v^0)^2 - (v^1)^2 - (v^2)^2 - (v^3)^2 = c^2. \]
Let's compute this to check if the given 4-velocity is consistent with natural units (\( c = 1 \)):
\[ 1^2 - (-2)^2 - 3^2 - 4^2 = 1 - 4 - 9 - 16 = 1 - 29 = -28. \]
This does not equal \( 1 \) (or \( c^2 \)), which suggests that either the units are not natural (\( c \neq 1 \)) or there is a different interpretation. However, since the problem specifies "units/second" and provides the 4-velocity directly, we can proceed by assuming the 4-velocity is given in the coordinate basis and use it to compute the position.

### Step 2: Relate 4-velocity to position
The 4-velocity is the derivative of the 4-position \( x = (ct, x, y, z) \) with respect to proper time \( \tau \):
\[ v^\mu = \frac{dx^\mu}{d\tau}. \]
To find the position after a given coordinate time, we need to integrate the 4-velocity with respect to proper time and relate proper time to coordinate time.

The coordinate time \( t \) is related to proper time \( \tau \) by:
\[ \frac{dt}{d\tau} = v^0 = \gamma. \]
In this case, the time component of the 4-velocity is \( v^0 = 1 \), so:
\[ \frac{dt}{d\tau} = 1, \]
which implies that \( t = \tau + \text{constant} \). Since the particle starts at \( (0, 0, 0, 0) \) at \( t = 0 \), we can take \( t = \tau \). This is unusual because it suggests \( \gamma = 1 \), meaning the particle is at rest in some frame, but the spatial components of the 4-velocity are non-zero, which contradicts the earlier magnitude calculation. This indicates a possible inconsistency in interpreting the problem's units or metric signature.

Given the problem's context, let's assume the time given (\( \sqrt{3} \) seconds) refers to coordinate time \( t \), and the 4-velocity components are given such that we can directly integrate them with respect to coordinate time to get the position (a common simplification in some contexts, though not strictly correct in relativity).

### Step 3: Compute the position
If we assume the 4-velocity components describe the rate of change of position with respect to coordinate time (i.e., treat \( v^\mu \) as \( \frac{dx^\mu}{dt} \)), then the position after time \( t = \sqrt{3} \) seconds is:
\[ x^\mu(t) = v^\mu \cdot t. \]
- For the time component: \( x^0 = v^0 \cdot t = 1 \cdot \sqrt{3} = \sqrt{3} \) (in units of time, or \( ct = \sqrt{3} \) if \( c = 1 \)),
- For the spatial components:
  - \( x^1 = v^1 \cdot t = -2 \cdot \sqrt{3} = -2\sqrt{3} \),
  - \( x^2 = v^2 \cdot t = 3 \cdot \sqrt{3} = 3\sqrt{3} \),
  - \( x^3 = v^3 \cdot t = 4 \cdot \sqrt{3} = 4\sqrt{3} \).

Thus, the 4-position after \( t = \sqrt{3} \) seconds is:
\[ x = (\sqrt{3}, -2\sqrt{3}, 3\sqrt{3}, 4\sqrt{3}). \]

### Step 4: Interpret the result
If \( x^0 = ct \), and assuming natural units (\( c = 1 \)), the time coordinate \( x^0 = \sqrt{3} \) corresponds to \( t = \sqrt{3} \), which matches the given time. The spatial coordinates are then \( (-2\sqrt{3}, 3\sqrt{3}, 4\sqrt{3}) \).

However, since the magnitude of the 4-velocity does not match the expected normalization, let's reconsider the proper time interpretation. The proper time \( \tau \) is related to coordinate time via \( \gamma \), but since \( v^0 = 1 \), and the spatial velocity magnitude is large, we compute \( \gamma \):
\[ |\mathbf{v}| = \sqrt{(-2)^2 + 3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{4 + 9 + 16} = \sqrt{29}, \]
so if \( c = 1 \), \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - |\mathbf{v}|^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 29}} \), which is imaginary and impossible. This confirms the 4-velocity is not normalized to \( c^2 \), suggesting a different metric or unit system.

### Final Answer
Given the problem's context and the simplest interpretation (treating the 4-velocity as the rate of change with respect to coordinate time), the position after \( t = \sqrt{3} \) seconds is:
\[ \boxed{(\sqrt{3}, -2\sqrt{3}, 3\sqrt{3}, 4\sqrt{3})}. \]
If the time \( \sqrt{3} \) seconds refers to proper time, the calculation would differ, but the problem likely intends coordinate time based on the phrasing. If further clarification on units or metric signature is needed, this answer assumes direct integration with respect to coordinate time.
