# Prompt #42: Four vectors in ℝ⁴ are  a = (1, 0, 0, 1),  b = (0, 1, 0, 1),  c = (0, 0, 1, 1),  d = (1, 1, 1, 1).  Compute the oriented 4-volume (determinant) of the parallelotope they span and state whether they form a right- or left-handed orientation.

## OpenAI o3  (42 secs)
Put the four vectors as the columns of a 4 × 4 matrix  

          1  0  0  1
     M =  0  1  0  1
          0  0  1  1
          1  1  1  1

and take its determinant.

Row-operation (R₄ ← R₄ − R₁) leaves the determinant unchanged:

          1  0  0  1
          0  1  0  1
          0  0  1  1
          0  1  1  0

Expand along the first column (only the 1 in the first row contributes):

det M = det
        1 0 1
        0 1 1
        1 1 0

For that 3 × 3 determinant,

det = 1(1·0 − 1·1) − 0(…) + 1(0·1 − 1·1) = (−1) + (−1) = −2.

Hence  

det M = −2.

Oriented 4-volume: −2  
(Un-oriented volume: 2)

Because the determinant is negative, the ordered set (a, b, c, d) gives a left-handed (opposite to the standard) orientation of ℝ⁴.

I need to find the determinant of the 4×4 matrix formed by these vectors and determine the orientation.

Let me arrange the vectors as columns of a matrix:
$$A = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 1
\end{pmatrix}$$

To find the determinant, I'll expand along the first row:

$$\det(A) = 1 \cdot \begin{vmatrix}
1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1
\end{vmatrix} - 0 + 0 - 1 \cdot \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1
\end{vmatrix}$$

For the first 3×3 determinant, expanding along the first row:
$$\begin{vmatrix}
1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1
\end{vmatrix} = 1 \cdot \begin{vmatrix}
1 & 1 \\
1 & 1
\end{vmatrix} - 0 + 1 \cdot \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & 1
\end{vmatrix}$$

$$= 1(1-1) + 1(0-1) = 0 - 1 = -1$$

For the second 3×3 determinant, expanding along the first row:
$$\begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1
\end{vmatrix} = 0 - 1 \cdot \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & 1
\end{vmatrix} + 0$$

$$= -1(0-1) = -1(-1) = 1$$

Therefore:
$$\det(A) = 1(-1) - 1(1) = -1 - 1 = -2$$

The oriented 4-volume of the parallelotope is $|-2| = 2$.

Since the determinant is negative ($-2 < 0$), the vectors form a **left-handed orientation**.

To verify this result, I can check that the vectors are linearly independent (which they are, since the determinant is non-zero) and note that the standard basis vectors $e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4$ form a right-handed system with determinant $+1$. Our system has a negative determinant, indicating the opposite orientation.

To compute the oriented 4-volume of the parallelotope spanned by the vectors a, b, c, and d, we need to calculate the determinant of the matrix whose rows (or columns) are these vectors. Let the vectors be:
a = (1, 0, 0, 1)
b = (0, 1, 0, 1)
c = (0, 0, 1, 1)
d = (1, 1, 1, 1)

Let M be the matrix whose rows are these vectors, in the given order:
$M = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$

We can compute the determinant of M using row operations to simplify the matrix to an upper triangular form.
1. Subtract Row 1 (R1) from Row 4 (R4): $R_4 \rightarrow R_4 - R_1$.
The new Row 4 becomes $(1-1, 1-0, 1-0, 1-1) = (0, 1, 1, 0)$.
The matrix becomes:
$M_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$
The determinant remains unchanged by this operation. $\det(M) = \det(M_1)$.

2. Subtract Row 2 (R2) from the new Row 4 (R4): $R_4 \rightarrow R_4 - R_2$.
The new Row 4 becomes $(0-0, 1-1, 1-0, 0-1) = (0, 0, 1, -1)$.
The matrix becomes:
$M_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 \end{pmatrix}$
The determinant remains unchanged. $\det(M) = \det(M_2)$.

3. Subtract Row 3 (R3) from the new Row 4 (R4): $R_4 \rightarrow R_4 - R_3$.
The new Row 4 becomes $(0-0, 0-0, 1-1, -1-1) = (0, 0, 0, -2)$.
The matrix becomes:
$M_3 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}$
The determinant remains unchanged. $\det(M) = \det(M_3)$.

This is an upper triangular matrix. The determinant of an upper triangular matrix is the product of its diagonal entries.
$\det(M) = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot (-2) = -2$.

Alternatively, we could use cofactor expansion. For example, expanding along the first row:
$\det(M) = 1 \cdot C_{11} + 0 \cdot C_{12} + 0 \cdot C_{13} + 1 \cdot C_{14}$
$C_{11} = \det \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix} = 1(1 \cdot 1 - 1 \cdot 1) - 0(\dots) + 1(0 \cdot 1 - 1 \cdot 1) = 1(0) + 1(-1) = -1$.
$C_{14} = (-1)^{1+4} \det \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix} = -1 [0(\dots) - 1(0 \cdot 1 - 1 \cdot 1) + 0(\dots)] = -1[-1(-1)] = -1[1] = -1$.
So, $\det(M) = 1 \cdot (-1) + 1 \cdot (-1) = -1 - 1 = -2$.

The oriented 4-volume of the parallelotope spanned by a, b, c, d is the determinant of the matrix M, which is -2.

The orientation of the vectors is determined by the sign of the determinant.
- If the determinant is positive, the vectors form a right-handed orientation (relative to the standard basis).
- If the determinant is negative, the vectors form a left-handed orientation.
- If the determinant is zero, the vectors are linearly dependent and do not span a 4-dimensional parallelotope.

Since $\det(M) = -2$, which is negative, the vectors a, b, c, d form a left-handed orientation.

Final Answer:
The oriented 4-volume is $\det(M) = -2$.
Since the determinant is negative, the set of vectors (a, b, c, d) forms a left-handed orientation.

The final answer is $\boxed{-2, \text{left-handed}}$.

The four vectors are given as \( \mathbf{a} = (1, 0, 0, 1) \), \( \mathbf{b} = (0, 1, 0, 1) \), \( \mathbf{c} = (0, 0, 1, 1) \), and \( \mathbf{d} = (1, 1, 1, 1) \).

To find the oriented 4-volume, compute the determinant of the matrix formed with these vectors as columns:
\[
A = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 1
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

Using row reduction to upper triangular form:
- Subtract row 1 from row 4:
  \[
  \begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
  0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
  0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
  0 & 1 & 1 & 0
  \end{pmatrix}.
  \]
- Subtract row 2 from row 4:
  \[
  \begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
  0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
  0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
  0 & 0 & 1 & -1
  \end{pmatrix}.
  \]
- Subtract row 3 from row 4:
  \[
  \begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
  0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
  0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & -2
  \end{pmatrix}.
  \]

The matrix is now upper triangular. The determinant is the product of the diagonal elements:
\[
\det(A) = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot (-2) = -2.
\]

The oriented 4-volume (determinant) is \(-2\).

The sign of the determinant indicates the orientation relative to the standard basis in \(\mathbb{R}^4\). The standard basis vectors \(\mathbf{e}_1 = (1, 0, 0, 0)\), \(\mathbf{e}_2 = (0, 1, 0, 0)\), \(\mathbf{e}_3 = (0, 0, 1, 0)\), \(\mathbf{e}_4 = (0, 0, 0, 1)\) form a right-handed system, with determinant 1. Since \(\det(A) = -2 < 0\), the given vectors form a left-handed orientation.

\boxed{-2}  
Left-handed orientation

## Grok 3  (8 secs)
To solve this problem, we need to compute the oriented 4-volume of the parallelotope spanned by the four vectors \( \mathbf{a} = (1, 0, 0, 1) \), \( \mathbf{b} = (0, 1, 0, 1) \), \( \mathbf{c} = (0, 0, 1, 1) \), and \( \mathbf{d} = (1, 1, 1, 1) \) in \( \mathbb{R}^4 \). This oriented volume is given by the determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors as columns (or rows). Additionally, we need to determine whether these vectors form a right-handed or left-handed orientation based on the sign of the determinant.

### Step 1: Form the Matrix
We construct a 4×4 matrix \( M \) with the vectors \( \mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}, \mathbf{c}, \mathbf{d} \) as its columns:

\[
M = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\]

### Step 2: Compute the Determinant
The oriented 4-volume of the parallelotope is the determinant of \( M \). We compute \( \det(M) \) using cofactor expansion along the first row:

\[
\det(M) = 1 \cdot \det(M_{11}) - 0 \cdot \det(M_{12}) + 0 \cdot \det(M_{13}) - 1 \cdot \det(M_{14})
\]

where \( M_{ij} \) is the minor matrix obtained by deleting the \( i \)-th row and \( j \)-th column of \( M \). Since the second and third terms are multiplied by 0, they vanish, so:

\[
\det(M) = 1 \cdot \det(M_{11}) - 1 \cdot \det(M_{14})
\]

Now, compute the determinants of the 3×3 minors \( M_{11} \) and \( M_{14} \).

- **Minor \( M_{11} \)** (delete row 1, column 1):

\[
M_{11} = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\]

Compute \( \det(M_{11}) \) using cofactor expansion along the first row:

\[
\det(M_{11}) = 1 \cdot \det\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix} - 0 \cdot \det\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix} + 1 \cdot \det\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

\[
= 1 \cdot (1 \cdot 1 - 1 \cdot 1) + 1 \cdot (0 \cdot 1 - 1 \cdot 1) = 1 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot (-1) = -1
\]

- **Minor \( M_{14} \)** (delete row 1, column 4):

\[
M_{14} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\]

Compute \( \det(M_{14}) \) using cofactor expansion along the first row:

\[
\det(M_{14}) = 0 \cdot \det\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix} - 1 \cdot \det\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix} + 0 \cdot \det\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

\[
= -1 \cdot (0 \cdot 1 - 1 \cdot 1) = -1 \cdot (-1) = 1
\]

Now, substitute back into the expression for \( \det(M) \):

\[
\det(M) = 1 \cdot (-1) - 1 \cdot 1 = -1 - 1 = -2
\]

Thus, the oriented 4-volume of the parallelotope is \( -2 \).

### Step 3: Determine the Orientation
The sign of the determinant indicates the orientation of the vectors relative to the standard basis of \( \mathbb{R}^4 \):
- A positive determinant corresponds to a right-handed orientation.
- A negative determinant corresponds to a left-handed orientation.

Since \( \det(M) = -2 < 0 \), the vectors \( \mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}, \mathbf{c}, \mathbf{d} \) form a **left-handed orientation**.

### Final Answer
- The oriented 4-volume (determinant) of the parallelotope spanned by the vectors is **-2**.
- The vectors form a **left-handed orientation**.
