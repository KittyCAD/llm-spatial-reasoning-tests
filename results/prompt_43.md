# Prompt #43: You’re given an L-tetromino on a grid: blocks at (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1). Rotate the piece 270° counter-clockwise about the origin, then reflect across the line y = x. List the four new coordinates in ascending x order.

## OpenAI o3  (12 secs)
Apply the transformations point-by-point.

1. 270° counter-clockwise rotation about the origin: (x, y) → (y, –x)  
2. Reflection across y = x: (a, b) → (b, a)

Original points → after rotation → after reflection:

(0, 0) → (0, 0) → (0, 0)  
(1, 0) → (0, –1) → (–1, 0)  
(2, 0) → (0, –2) → (–2, 0)  
(2, 1) → (1, –2) → (–2, 1)

Now list them in ascending x order:

(–2, 0), (–2, 1), (–1, 0), (0, 0).

I need to transform an L-tetromino by first rotating 270° counter-clockwise about the origin, then reflecting across the line y = x.

Starting coordinates: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1)

Step 1: Rotate 270° counter-clockwise about the origin.
For a 270° counter-clockwise rotation (or 90° clockwise), the transformation is:
(x,y) → (y,-x)

Applying this to each point:
- (0,0) → (0,0)
- (1,0) → (0,-1)
- (2,0) → (0,-2)
- (2,1) → (1,-2)

After rotation: (0,0), (0,-1), (0,-2), (1,-2)

Step 2: Reflect across the line y = x.
For reflection across y = x, the transformation is:
(x,y) → (y,x)

Applying this to each rotated point:
- (0,0) → (0,0)
- (0,-1) → (-1,0)
- (0,-2) → (-2,0)
- (1,-2) → (-2,1)

Final coordinates: (0,0), (-1,0), (-2,0), (-2,1)

Step 3: List in ascending x order.
Sorting by x-coordinate (then by y if needed):
(-2,0), (-2,1), (-1,0), (0,0)

The four new coordinates in ascending x order are: (-2,0), (-2,1), (-1,0), (0,0)

The initial coordinates of the L-tetromino are:
P1 = (0,0)
P2 = (1,0)
P3 = (2,0)
P4 = (2,1)

Step 1: Rotate the piece 270° counter-clockwise about the origin.
The rule for a 270° counter-clockwise rotation about the origin is (x, y) → (y, -x).
Applying this transformation to each point:
P1' = (0, -0) = (0,0)
P2' = (0, -1) = (0,-1)
P3' = (0, -2) = (0,-2)
P4' = (1, -2) = (1,-2)

So, after the rotation, the new coordinates are:
P1' = (0,0)
P2' = (0,-1)
P3' = (0,-2)
P4' = (1,-2)

Step 2: Reflect the rotated piece across the line y = x.
The rule for reflection across the line y = x is (x, y) → (y, x).
Applying this transformation to the rotated points:
P1'' = (0, 0)
P2'' = (-1, 0)
P3'' = (-2, 0)
P4'' = (-2, 1)

So, after the reflection, the new coordinates are:
P1'' = (0,0)
P2'' = (-1,0)
P3'' = (-2,0)
P4'' = (-2,1)

Step 3: List the four new coordinates in ascending x order.
The new coordinates are (0,0), (-1,0), (-2,0), (-2,1).
We sort these coordinates based on their x-values in ascending order. If two points have the same x-value, we sort them by their y-values in ascending order.
The x-coordinates are 0, -1, -2, -2.
Sorted x-coordinates: -2, -2, -1, 0.

The points corresponding to these x-coordinates are:
For x = -2: (-2,0) and (-2,1). Sorted by y-coordinate: (-2,0), (-2,1).
For x = -1: (-1,0).
For x = 0: (0,0).

Listing them in ascending x order (and then y order for ties):
1. (-2,0)
2. (-2,1)
3. (-1,0)
4. (0,0)

The four new coordinates in ascending x order are (-2,0), (-2,1), (-1,0), (0,0).

The final answer is $\boxed{(-2,0), (-2,1), (-1,0), (0,0)}$.

The original coordinates of the L-tetromino are (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), and (2,1).

First, apply a 270° counter-clockwise rotation about the origin. The transformation for a point (x, y) under this rotation is:
- \( x' = y \)
- \( y' = -x \)

Applying this to each point:
- (0,0) → (0, 0)  [since \( x' = 0 \), \( y' = -0 = 0 \)]
- (1,0) → (0, -1)  [since \( x' = 0 \), \( y' = -1 = -1 \)]
- (2,0) → (0, -2)  [since \( x' = 0 \), \( y' = -2 = -2 \)]
- (2,1) → (1, -2)  [since \( x' = 1 \), \( y' = -2 = -2 \)]

The points after rotation are (0,0), (0,-1), (0,-2), and (1,-2).

Next, reflect these points across the line \( y = x \). Reflection across \( y = x \) swaps the x and y coordinates, so a point (a, b) becomes (b, a).

Applying this to each rotated point:
- (0,0) → (0, 0)  [swapped: (0,0)]
- (0,-1) → (-1, 0)  [swapped: (-1, 0)]
- (0,-2) → (-2, 0)  [swapped: (-2, 0)]
- (1,-2) → (-2, 1)  [swapped: (-2, 1)]

The points after reflection are (0,0), (-1,0), (-2,0), and (-2,1).

Now, list these points in ascending order of x-coordinate:
- The x-coordinates are -2, -2, -1, 0.
- For the points with x = -2: (-2,0) and (-2,1). Since the x-coordinates are the same, list them in ascending order of y-coordinate: (-2,0) then (-2,1).
- Next, the point with x = -1: (-1,0).
- Finally, the point with x = 0: (0,0).

Thus, the four new coordinates in ascending x order are (-2, 0), (-2, 1), (-1, 0), (0, 0).

\boxed{(-2, 0)} \boxed{(-2, 1)} \boxed{(-1, 0)} \boxed{(0, 0)}

## Grok 3  (5 secs)
Let's solve this step by step. We start with an L-tetromino on a grid with blocks at the coordinates (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), and (2,1). We need to rotate it 270° counter-clockwise about the origin, then reflect it across the line y = x, and finally list the new coordinates in ascending x-order.

### Step 1: Rotate 270° Counter-Clockwise About the Origin
A 270° counter-clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 90° clockwise rotation. For a point (x, y), a 90° clockwise rotation about the origin transforms it to (y, -x). Let's apply this transformation to each of the given points:

- (0,0) → (0, 0) (remains the same, as it's the origin)
- (1,0) → (0, -1)
- (2,0) → (0, -2)
- (2,1) → (1, -2)

So, after the 270° counter-clockwise rotation, the new coordinates are:
- (0,0)
- (0,-1)
- (0,-2)
- (1,-2)

---

### Step 2: Reflect Across the Line y = x
Reflecting a point across the line y = x swaps the x and y coordinates. For a point (x, y), the reflection is (y, x). Let's apply this to the rotated coordinates:

- (0,0) → (0,0)
- (0,-1) → (-1,0)
- (0,-2) → (-2,0)
- (1,-2) → (-2,1)

So, after the reflection, the new coordinates are:
- (0,0)
- (-1,0)
- (-2,0)
- (-2,1)

---

### Step 3: List the Coordinates in Ascending x-Order
Now, we sort the coordinates based on the x-values in ascending order (smallest to largest). If x-values are equal, we can list them as they are since the problem doesn't specify sorting by y.

The coordinates are:
- x = -2: (-2,0) and (-2,1)
- x = -1: (-1,0)
- x = 0: (0,0)

Listing them in ascending x-order:
- (-2,0)
- (-2,1)
- (-1,0)
- (0,0)

---

### Final Answer
The four new coordinates after the transformations, listed in ascending x-order, are:
- (-2,0)
- (-2,1)
- (-1,0)
- (0,0)
