# Prompt #44: A solid right-circular cone (height 8 cm, base radius 3 cm) is sliced by a plane parallel to its base 3 cm below the apex. Name the resulting cross-section and give its area.

## OpenAI o3  (11 secs)
Because the cutting plane is parallel to the base of a right-circular cone, it intersects the cone in a circle.

Similarity of the cone’s cross-sections  
A line from the apex to the center of the base gives two similar right triangles:

small cone height / whole cone height = small radius / base radius  
3 cm / 8 cm = r / 3 cm  ⟹  r = 3·(3/8) = 9/8 cm.

Area of the circle  
A = π r² = π(9/8)² = 81π/64 cm² ≈ 3.98 cm².

Result  
Cross-section: circle  
Area: 81π/64 cm².

I need to find the cross-section of a cone when sliced by a plane parallel to its base.

Given information:
- Original cone: height = 8 cm, base radius = 3 cm
- Plane is parallel to the base, 3 cm below the apex

Since the plane is parallel to the base of the cone, the cross-section will be similar to the base. The base of a cone is a circle, so the cross-section will also be a **circle**.

To find the radius of this circular cross-section, I'll use similar triangles.

When we slice the cone 3 cm below the apex, we're essentially looking at a smaller cone of height 3 cm. The ratio of corresponding lengths in similar cones equals the ratio of their heights.

For the original cone:
- Height = 8 cm
- Base radius = 3 cm

For the smaller cone (from apex to cutting plane):
- Height = 3 cm
- Base radius = r (what we need to find)

Using the property of similar triangles:
$$\frac{r}{3} = \frac{3}{8}$$

Solving for r:
$$r = 3 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{9}{8} \text{ cm}$$

The area of the circular cross-section is:
$$A = \pi r^2 = \pi \left(\frac{9}{8}\right)^2 = \pi \times \frac{81}{64} = \frac{81\pi}{64} \text{ cm}^2$$

Therefore:
- The cross-section is a **circle**
- Its area is **$\frac{81\pi}{64}$ cm²** (approximately 3.98 cm²)

Let H be the height of the original cone and R be its base radius.
Given: H = 8 cm, R = 3 cm.

The cone is sliced by a plane parallel to its base. When a right-circular cone is sliced by a plane parallel to its base, the resulting cross-section is a circle. If the cone is solid, the cross-section is a disk. The boundary of this disk is a circle. In common geometric language, "circle" is often used to refer to this disk-shaped cross-section, especially when its area is discussed.

Let h' be the distance from the apex to the slicing plane.
Given: h' = 3 cm.

Let r' be the radius of the circular cross-section.
We can find r' using the properties of similar triangles. Consider a vertical cross-section of the cone passing through its apex and the center of its base. This 2D cross-section shows two similar triangles:
1. A larger triangle with height H (the height of the original cone) and base R (the radius of the original cone's base).
2. A smaller triangle (representing the small cone that is above the slicing plane) with height h' (the distance from the apex to the slicing plane) and base r' (the radius of the cross-section).

These two triangles are right-angled triangles (if we consider the triangles formed by the axis, the radius, and the slant height). The larger triangle has sides H and R. The smaller triangle has sides h' and r'. They share a common angle at the apex, and the sides representing the radii (R and r') are parallel as the slicing plane is parallel to the base. Thus, these triangles are similar.

The ratio of corresponding sides in similar triangles is equal:
r' / R = h' / H

We can substitute the given values:
r' / 3 cm = 3 cm / 8 cm
r' = 3 cm * (3/8)
r' = 9/8 cm

The cross-section is a circle of radius r' = 9/8 cm.
The area of this circular cross-section (disk) is given by the formula A = π * (r')^2.
A = π * (9/8 cm)^2
A = π * (81/64) cm^2
A = (81/64)π cm^2

So, the name of the resulting cross-section is a circle (or more technically, a disk, as the cone is solid). The area of this cross-section is (81/64)π cm^2.

The name of the resulting cross-section is a circle.
The area of the cross-section is (81/64)π cm^2.

The final answer is $\boxed{Circle, \frac{81\pi}{64} \text{ cm}^2}$.

The plane is parallel to the base of the cone, so the resulting cross-section is a circle.

To find the radius of this circle, consider the similar triangles formed by the cross-section. The full cone has a height of 8 cm and a base radius of 3 cm. The slice is 3 cm below the apex, so the distance from the apex to the slice is 3 cm.

The ratio of the distance from the apex to the slice to the full height is \( \frac{3}{8} \). By similarity, the radius of the cross-section circle is proportional:

\[
\text{radius} = 3 \, \text{cm} \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{9}{8} \, \text{cm}
\]

The area of the circle is then:

\[
\text{area} = \pi \left( \frac{9}{8} \right)^2 = \pi \times \frac{81}{64} = \frac{81\pi}{64} \, \text{cm}^2
\]

Thus, the cross-section is a circle with an area of \( \frac{81\pi}{64} \, \text{cm}^2 \).

\boxed{\text{circle}} \quad \boxed{\dfrac{81\pi}{64} \text{ cm}^2}

When a solid right-circular cone is sliced by a plane parallel to its base, the resulting cross-section is a circle. This is because the plane intersects the cone in a way that mirrors the shape of the base, just at a smaller scale, due to the conical geometry.

To determine the area of this circular cross-section, we need to find the radius of the circle formed at the height where the plane intersects the cone. The cone has a height of 8 cm and a base radius of 3 cm. The plane is 3 cm below the apex, which means it is at a height of 3 cm from the apex (since the apex is the top point of the cone).

### Step 1: Use similar triangles to find the radius of the cross-section
The cone's geometry allows us to use the principle of similar triangles. The full cone has a height of 8 cm and a base radius of 3 cm. At a height of 3 cm from the apex, the smaller cone (from the apex to the plane) is similar to the original cone.

- Height of the full cone, \( H = 8 \, \text{cm} \)
- Base radius of the full cone, \( R = 3 \, \text{cm} \)
- Height of the smaller cone (up to the plane), \( h = 3 \, \text{cm} \)
- Radius of the cross-section at height \( h \), \( r = ? \)

Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides is equal to the ratio of their heights:
\[
\frac{r}{R} = \frac{h}{H}
\]
\[
\frac{r}{3} = \frac{3}{8}
\]
\[
r = 3 \cdot \frac{3}{8} = \frac{9}{8} = 1.125 \, \text{cm}
\]

So, the radius of the circular cross-section is \( 1.125 \, \text{cm} \).

### Step 2: Calculate the area of the cross-section
The area \( A \) of a circle is given by the formula:
\[
A = \pi r^2
\]
Substitute \( r = 1.125 \, \text{cm} \):
\[
A = \pi \cdot (1.125)^2 = \pi \cdot 1.265625
\]
\[
A = 1.265625\pi \, \text{cm}^2
\]

If we approximate \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \), the area is approximately:
\[
A \approx 1.265625 \cdot 3.1416 \approx 3.976 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

However, since the problem does not specify to approximate, we can leave the answer in terms of \( \pi \). For precision, note that \( 1.125 = \frac{9}{8} \), so:
\[
r^2 = \left(\frac{9}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{81}{64}
\]
\[
A = \pi \cdot \frac{81}{64} = \frac{81\pi}{64} \, \text{cm}^2
\]

### Final Answer:
The resulting cross-section is a **circle**, and its area is \( \frac{81\pi}{64} \, \text{cm}^2 \) (or approximately \( 3.976 \, \text{cm}^2 \), if a numerical approximation is desired).
