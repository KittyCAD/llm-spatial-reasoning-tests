# Prompt #45: Take the block letter ‘R’. Rotate it 180° about a horizontal axis lying in its plane (not a vertical flip). ASCII-draw what you see.

## OpenAI o3  (75 secs)
Here’s one simple “block-R”, then the same shape after a 180° turn about a horizontal axis in its plane (i.e. turned upside-down, not mirrored left/right).

Original R

```
***** 
*    *
*    *
***** 
*   *
*    *
*     *
```

After the 180° horizontal-axis rotation

```
*     *
*    *
*   *
***** 
*    *
*    *
***** 
```

(Any chosen character – ‘*’, ‘#’, ‘R’, etc. – will work; what matters is that the top of the R has become its bottom and the slanted leg now rises instead of falling.)

When you rotate the letter 'R' 180° about a horizontal axis lying in its plane, you get an upside-down R. Here it is in ASCII:

```
  ┴
 / \
/   \
\   /
 \_/
  |
  |
```

Or in a simpler ASCII style:

```
    |
    |
   / \
  /   \
  \   /
   \_/
    |
```

Or even more simply:

```
  |
  |
 / \
(   )
 \_/
  |
```

The key features are:
- The vertical stem is now at the top
- The rounded part that was at the top-right is now at the bottom-left
- The diagonal leg that extended down-right is now extending up-left

Okay, let's first draw a standard block letter 'R':

```
#####
#   #
#   #
#####
#  #
#   #
#    #
```

Now, if we rotate this 180° about a horizontal axis lying in its plane, the top becomes the bottom and the bottom becomes the top, but the left side remains the left side, and the right side remains the right side. It's essentially turning it upside down.

So, the bottom row ` #    # ` becomes the top row.
The second from bottom ` #   # ` becomes the second from top.
And so on.

Here's the result:

```
#    #
#   #
#  #
#####
#   #
#   #
#####
```

If you look closely, this is the original 'R' turned upside down.

When rotating the block letter 'R' 180° about a horizontal axis in its plane (like flipping it over horizontally in 3D space), the resulting view is the mirror image of the original, with the top and bottom swapped. For a standard 5x5 block 'R':

```
#####
#   #
#####
#  # 
#   #
```

After rotation:
1. **Mirror horizontally**: Each row is reversed left-to-right.
2. **Swap top and bottom**: The order of the rows is reversed.

**Step-by-step transformation**:

1. Original rows:
   - Row 1: `#####` → Reversed: `#####` (symmetric)
   - Row 2: `#   #` → Reversed: `#   #` (symmetric)
   - Row 3: `#####` → Reversed: `#####` (symmetric)
   - Row 4: `#  # ` → Reversed: ` #  #` (note: space at start)
   - Row 5: `#   #` → Reversed: `#   #` (symmetric)

2. Reverse row order:
   - New Row 1: Reversed Row 5 = `#   #`
   - New Row 2: Reversed Row 4 = ` #  #`
   - New Row 3: Reversed Row 3 = `#####`
   - New Row 4: Reversed Row 2 = `#   #`
   - New Row 5: Reversed Row 1 = `#####`

**Resulting ASCII art**:
```
#   #
 #  #
#####
#   #
#####
```

**Explanation of the output**:
- The top part (original bottom) becomes the new top, mirrored.
- The curved part of 'R' (originally at the top) is now mirrored and at the bottom.
- The vertical stem and diagonal are mirrored and repositioned.

This is the view after the 180° rotation about the horizontal axis.

Let's visualize this step by step. The block letter 'R' in ASCII art can be represented as follows (a simple depiction):

```
RRRR
R   R
R   R
RRRR
R   R
R    R
```

Now, we need to rotate this letter 180° about a horizontal axis lying in its plane. This means we're flipping it upside down along a horizontal line that passes through the center of the 'R'. This is not a vertical flip (mirror image left-to-right) but a rotation that turns the top to the bottom and vice versa.

After a 180° rotation about a horizontal axis:
- The top row becomes the bottom row, and the bottom row becomes the top row.
- The orientation of the letter will appear upside down.

Performing this rotation on the ASCII art above, the result would look like this:

```
R    R
R   R
RRRR
R   R
R   R
RRRR
```

This represents the 'R' flipped upside down, where the top of the original 'R' is now at the bottom, and the bottom is at the top. If you imagine turning the original 'R' upside down, the legs of the 'R' are now pointing upward, and the loop or curve is at the bottom. This ASCII drawing approximates that transformation.
