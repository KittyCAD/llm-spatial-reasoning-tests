# Prompt #47: A unit cube sits with one corner at the origin. A plane passes through (0,½,½), (½,0,½) and (½,½,0). List the polygon vertices produced, in cyclic order.

The three points lie on the plane  

x + y + z = 1.

Inside the unit cube 0 ≤ x,y,z ≤ 1 this plane meets the cube only where x, y and z are not all zero; its intersection occurs at the three cube‐corners that satisfy the same equation:

1. (0,0,1)   (where x=0, y=0, z=1)  
2. (0,1,0)   (where x=0, y=1, z=0)  
3. (1,0,0)   (where x=1, y=0, z=0)

Thus the cross–section is the triangle with these vertices.  
In cyclic (counter-clockwise) order the vertices are  

(0,0,1)  →  (0,1,0)  →  (1,0,0).

I need to find where the plane intersects the edges of the unit cube.

First, let me find the equation of the plane passing through the three given points:
- A = (0, 1/2, 1/2)
- B = (1/2, 0, 1/2)  
- C = (1/2, 1/2, 0)

To find the plane equation, I'll use two vectors in the plane:
- AB = B - A = (1/2, -1/2, 0)
- AC = C - A = (1/2, 0, -1/2)

The normal vector is AB × AC:
n = AB × AC = (1/4, 1/4, 1/4) = (1/4)(1, 1, 1)

So the plane equation is x + y + z = d. Using point A:
0 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 1

Therefore, the plane equation is: x + y + z = 1

Now I'll check which edges of the unit cube this plane intersects. The vertices of the unit cube are:
- (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1)
- (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1), (1,1,1)

For each edge, I'll find if and where the plane intersects it.

The plane x + y + z = 1 intersects an edge when one endpoint has x + y + z < 1 and the other has x + y + z > 1.

Checking vertices:
- (0,0,0): 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 < 1
- (1,0,0): 1 + 0 + 0 = 1 = 1
- (0,1,0): 0 + 1 + 0 = 1 = 1
- (0,0,1): 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 = 1
- (1,1,0): 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 > 1
- (1,0,1): 1 + 0 + 1 = 2 > 1
- (0,1,1): 0 + 1 + 1 = 2 > 1
- (1,1,1): 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 > 1

The vertices (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1) lie exactly on the plane.

The plane separates the cube into two parts:
- Below the plane: (0,0,0)
- Above the plane: (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1), (1,1,1)

The intersection forms a triangle with vertices at:
- (1,0,0)
- (0,1,0)
- (0,0,1)

Wait, let me reconsider. I should also check for intersections with edges that don't have endpoints exactly on the plane.

Actually, I notice that the three given points (0,1/2,1/2), (1/2,0,1/2), (1/2,1/2,0) are the midpoints of three edges of the cube. Let me verify they satisfy x + y + z = 1:
- (0,1/2,1/2): 0 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 1 ✓
- (1/2,0,1/2): 1/2 + 0 + 1/2 = 1 ✓
- (1/2,1/2,0): 1/2 + 1/2 + 0 = 1 ✓

So the plane passes through these three edge midpoints and the three vertices (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1).

The intersection polygon is a hexagon with vertices (in cyclic order):
- (1, 0, 0)
- (1/2, 0, 1/2)
- (0, 0, 1)

The plane \(x + y + z = 1\) intersects the unit cube with vertices from (0,0,0) to (1,1,1). The intersection points with the cube's edges occur only at the corners (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1), forming a triangular polygon.

These vertices are connected in cyclic order as follows:
- From (1,0,0) to (0,1,0) along the edge where \(z = 0\).
- From (0,1,0) to (0,0,1) along the edge where \(x = 0\).
- From (0,0,1) to (1,0,0) along the edge where \(y = 0\).

The given points (0,½,½), (½,0,½), and (½,½,0) lie on the edges of this polygon but are not vertices; they are the midpoints of the sides.

Thus, the polygon vertices in cyclic order are (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1).

\boxed{(1,0,0)} \boxed{(0,1,0)} \boxed{(0,0,1)}

To solve this problem, we need to determine the vertices of the polygon formed by the intersection of a plane with a unit cube. The cube has one corner at the origin (0,0,0) and extends to (1,1,1), and the plane passes through the points (0, ½, ½), (½, 0, ½), and (½, ½, 0). We will find the vertices of the polygon formed by the plane intersecting the cube's faces and list them in cyclic order.

---

### Step 1: Define the cube and the plane
The unit cube has vertices at:
- (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (1,1,0), (0,0,1), (1,0,1), (0,1,1), (1,1,1).

The plane passes through the points (0, ½, ½), (½, 0, ½), and (½, ½, 0). To find the equation of the plane, we use the general form of a plane equation: ax + by + cz = d.

Using the three points, we set up the system of equations:
- For (0, ½, ½): (b/2) + (c/2) = d
- For (½, 0, ½): (a/2) + (c/2) = d
- For (½, ½, 0): (a/2) + (b/2) = d

Solving these:
- From the first: b/2 + c/2 = d ⇒ b + c = 2d
- From the second: a/2 + c/2 = d ⇒ a + c = 2d
- From the third: a/2 + b/2 = d ⇒ a + b = 2d

Setting d = ½ (to simplify), we get:
- a + c = 1
- b + c = 1
- a + b = 1

From a + b = 1 and a + c = 1, we get b = c.
From b + c = 1, we get 2b = 1 ⇒ b = ½, c = ½, and a = 1 - b = ½.

Thus, the plane equation is:
(½)x + (½)y + (½)z = ½
Multiplying through by 2 to simplify:
x + y + z = 1

So, the plane is defined by x + y + z = 1.

---

### Step 2: Find the intersection points of the plane with the cube
The cube's faces are defined by x=0, x=1, y=0, y=1, z=0, and z=1. We will substitute these into the plane equation to find the lines of intersection on each face, then determine the vertices where the plane intersects the cube's edges.

- **Face x=0**: Plane equation becomes 0 + y + z = 1 ⇒ y + z = 1. For 0 ≤ y ≤ 1, 0 ≤ z ≤ 1, the line segment is from (0,0,1) to (0,1,0).
- **Face x=1**: Plane equation becomes 1 + y + z = 1 ⇒ y + z = 0. Since y and z are between 0 and 1, y = z = 0 is the only solution, which is the point (1,0,0).
- **Face y=0**: Plane equation becomes x + 0 + z = 1 ⇒ x + z = 1. For 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ z ≤ 1, the line segment is from (0,0,1) to (1,0,0).
- **Face y=1**: Plane equation becomes x + 1 + z = 1 ⇒ x + z = 0. Solution is x = z = 0, which is (0,1,0).
- **Face z=0**: Plane equation becomes x + y + 0 = 1 ⇒ x + y = 1. For 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1, the line segment is from (0,1,0) to (1,0,0).
- **Face z=1**: Plane equation becomes x + y + 1 = 1 ⇒ x + y = 0. Solution is x = y = 0, which is (0,0,1).

The vertices of the intersection polygon are where these line segments meet, i.e., the points (0,0,1), (0,1,0), and (1,0,0).

---

### Step 3: Verify the vertices and determine cyclic order
The plane intersects the cube at the following points:
- (0,0,1) (on edges of faces x=0, y=0, z=1)
- (0,1,0) (on edges of faces x=0, y=1, z=0)
- (1,0,0) (on edges of faces x=1, y=0, z=0)

These three points form a triangle, as the plane cuts through three faces of the cube, intersecting at these vertices. To list them in cyclic order, we trace the boundary of the intersection polygon:
- Start at (1,0,0), move to (0,0,1) along the edge on face y=0.
- From (0,0,1), move to (0,1,0) along the edge on face x=0.
- From (0,1,0), move to (1,0,0) along the edge on face z=0.

Thus, the cyclic order of the vertices is (1,0,0), (0,0,1), (0,1,0).

---

### Step 4: Confirm with the given points
The problem specifies that the plane passes through (0,½,½), (½,0,½), and (½,½,0). Let's verify these points lie on the plane x + y + z = 1:
- (0,½,½): 0 + ½ + ½ = 1 (satisfied)
- (½,0,½): ½ + 0 + ½ = 1 (satisfied)
- (½,½,0): ½ + ½ + 0 = 1 (satisfied)

These points are midpoints of the edges of the cube, confirming the plane cuts through the cube symmetrically, forming a triangle with vertices at (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1).

---

### Final Answer
The polygon vertices produced by the intersection of the plane with the unit cube, listed in cyclic order, are:
**(1,0,0), (0,0,1), (0,1,0)**.
