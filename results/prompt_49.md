# Prompt #49: Imagine a regular dodecagon. If you delete every second vertex and connect the remaining ones, what polygon results? Explain.

## OpenAI o3  (23 secs)
Call the vertices of the regular dodecagon  
V₀ , V₁ , V₂ , … , V₁₁ in order around the figure.  
Because the dodecagon is regular, the vertices lie on a
circle and the central angle between successive vertices is

360° / 12 = 30°.

“Delete every second vertex’’ means keep the vertices with even
indices and discard those with odd indices:

kept:  V₀ , V₂ , V₄ , V₆ , V₈ , V₁₀  
gone:  V₁ , V₃ , V₅ , V₇ , V₉ , V₁₁

Each pair of consecutive kept vertices is separated by two of the
original 30° arcs, so the central angle between any two adjacent
kept vertices is

2 × 30° = 60°.

Hence the six remaining vertices are equally spaced 60° apart on
the same circle.

A set of points that are equally spaced on a circle forms a regular
polygon; in this case there are six such points, so the figure you
get by joining them in order is a regular hexagon.

(Equivalently, the chord joining any neighbouring kept vertices is
the same length, giving all-equal sides, and the equal central
angles give all-equal interior angles.)

Therefore, after removing every second vertex of a regular
dodecagon and connecting the six remaining vertices, the resulting
polygon is a regular hexagon.

I need to think about what happens when we remove every second vertex from a regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon) and connect the remaining vertices.

Let me label the vertices of the dodecagon as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 going around in order.

If I delete every second vertex, I have two possible interpretations:
- Delete vertices 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 (keeping odd-numbered vertices)
- Delete vertices 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 (keeping even-numbered vertices)

Let me work with the first case (keeping odd vertices): 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11

When I connect these remaining vertices in order, I'm connecting:
- Vertex 1 to vertex 3
- Vertex 3 to vertex 5
- Vertex 5 to vertex 7
- Vertex 7 to vertex 9
- Vertex 9 to vertex 11
- Vertex 11 to vertex 1

Since we started with 12 vertices and kept 6 of them, we now have a 6-sided polygon - a hexagon.

Moreover, this hexagon is regular. Here's why:
- In the original dodecagon, all vertices were equally spaced around a circle (360°/12 = 30° apart)
- By taking every other vertex, we're taking vertices that are 2 × 30° = 60° apart
- The 6 remaining vertices are therefore equally spaced around the circle (360°/6 = 60° apart)
- All sides of this hexagon have the same length (they're all chords of the circle subtending the same angle)
- All interior angles are equal

Therefore, deleting every second vertex from a regular dodecagon and connecting the remaining vertices results in a **regular hexagon**.

Let's visualize or list the vertices of a regular dodecagon.
A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices. Let's label them V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7, V8, V9, V10, V11, V12 in order around the polygon.

The process is to "delete every second vertex." This means we keep a vertex, then delete the next, keep the next, delete the next, and so on.

1.  Keep V1.
2.  Delete V2.
3.  Keep V3.
4.  Delete V4.
5.  Keep V5.
6.  Delete V6.
7.  Keep V7.
8.  Delete V8.
9.  Keep V9.
10. Delete V10.
11. Keep V11.
12. Delete V12.

The remaining vertices are: V1, V3, V5, V7, V9, V11.

Now, we connect these remaining vertices in order to form a new polygon.
The number of remaining vertices is 6. A polygon with 6 vertices is a hexagon.

To determine if it's a *regular* hexagon, we need to consider the properties of the original regular dodecagon:
1.  All its vertices lie on a common circle (its circumcircle).
2.  The distance (arc length or central angle) between any two consecutive vertices is the same. The central angle subtended by each side of the regular dodecagon is 360°/12 = 30°.

When we select every other vertex (V1, V3, V5, V7, V9, V11):
*   All these selected vertices still lie on the same original circumcircle.
*   The original vertices V1, V2, V3, ..., V12 were equally spaced.
*   The arc from V1 to V3 passes over V2. The central angle from V1 to V3 is the sum of the central angles V1-Center-V2 and V2-Center-V3, which is 30° + 30° = 60°.
*   Similarly, the central angle from V3 to V5 is 60°.
*   This pattern continues for all consecutive pairs of the remaining vertices: V5 to V7, V7 to V9, V9 to V11, and V11 back to V1. Each pair subtends a central angle of 60°.

Since the new set of 6 vertices are all on the same circle and are equally spaced around that circle (each separated by a central angle of 60°), the polygon formed by connecting them will have:
1.  Equal side lengths (as they are chords subtending equal central angles in the same circle).
2.  Equal interior angles.

A polygon with equal side lengths and equal interior angles is a regular polygon.
Since it has 6 vertices, it is a **regular hexagon**.

The central angle of this new regular hexagon would be 360°/6 = 60°, which matches our calculation.

Conclusion:
If you delete every second vertex of a regular dodecagon and connect the remaining ones, the resulting polygon is a **regular hexagon**.

When every second vertex of a regular dodecagon is deleted, half of the vertices are removed, leaving six vertices. These remaining vertices are equally spaced on the circumscribed circle of the original dodecagon.

A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices, each separated by an angular distance of 30° (since 360° / 12 = 30°). Deleting every second vertex means removing vertices such that the angular separation between consecutive remaining vertices is 60°. For example, if the vertices are labeled 1 to 12 with vertex 1 at 0°, the remaining vertices after deletion could be vertices 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 at angles 0°, 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, and 300°, respectively. Alternatively, if vertices 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 are kept (at 30°, 90°, 150°, 210°, 270°, and 330°), the angular positions are simply rotated by 30°, but the relative angular separations remain the same.

Connecting these six remaining vertices in cyclic order forms a new polygon. Since the vertices are equally spaced at 60° intervals on the circle, the resulting polygon has equal side lengths and equal internal angles, making it a regular hexagon. The side length of this hexagon corresponds to the chord length spanning 60° in the original circle, which is longer than the side length of the dodecagon (spanning 30°), but this does not affect the regularity of the hexagon.

In general, for a regular \(n\)-gon, deleting every second vertex (step size \(s = 2\)) results in a regular polygon with \(n / \gcd(n, s)\) sides. Here, \(n = 12\) and \(s = 2\), so \(\gcd(12, 2) = 2\), and the number of sides is \(12 / 2 = 6\), confirming a regular hexagon.

Thus, the polygon resulting from deleting every second vertex of a regular dodecagon and connecting the remaining vertices is a regular hexagon.

\boxed{\text{regular hexagon}}

## Grok 3  (13 secs)
Let’s solve this problem step-by-step by visualizing a regular dodecagon, which is a 12-sided polygon with equal side lengths and equal interior angles. We are tasked with deleting every second vertex and connecting the remaining vertices to see what polygon results.

First, label the vertices of the dodecagon in order, starting from one vertex and moving clockwise: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Deleting every second vertex means removing vertices 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. This leaves us with vertices 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11—exactly 6 vertices.

Next, we connect these remaining vertices in the order they appear around the dodecagon: 1 to 3, 3 to 5, 5 to 7, 7 to 9, 9 to 11, and 11 back to 1. This forms a closed shape with 6 sides, suggesting a hexagon. However, we need to determine if this hexagon is regular (all sides and angles equal) and whether it matches the original dodecagon's structure or forms a different shape.

In a regular dodecagon, the vertices are equally spaced around a circle (the circumcircle). Each vertex is separated by a central angle of 360°/12 = 30°. So, vertex 1 is at 0°, vertex 2 at 30°, vertex 3 at 60°, vertex 4 at 90°, and so on, up to vertex 12 at 330°. After deleting every second vertex, the remaining vertices (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11) correspond to central angles of 0°, 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, and 300°. These angles are spaced 60° apart (e.g., 60° - 0° = 60°, 120° - 60° = 60°, etc.), which is exactly the spacing of vertices in a regular hexagon inscribed in the same circle (since a regular hexagon has central angles of 360°/6 = 60° between adjacent vertices).

Now, consider the side lengths. In a regular dodecagon inscribed in a circle of radius \(r\), the length of a chord (side) spanning a central angle of \(\theta\) is given by \(2r \sin(\theta/2)\). For the original dodecagon, each side spans 30°, so the side length is \(2r \sin(15°)\). In the new shape, connecting the remaining vertices (e.g., 1 to 3) spans a central angle of 60°, so the side length is \(2r \sin(30°) = 2r \cdot 0.5 = r\). Since all sides of the new shape span 60° central angles, they all have the same length \(r\).

Additionally, in a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle, the side length is equal to the radius \(r\), which matches our calculation. The interior angles of the new shape should also be consistent with a regular hexagon. A regular hexagon has interior angles of 120°, and since the original dodecagon is regular and we're connecting vertices symmetrically, the resulting shape maintains this regularity.

To confirm, note that selecting every second vertex in a dodecagon (a 12-gon) is equivalent to selecting every (12/6)=2nd vertex, forming a 6-gon. More generally, for a regular \(n\)-gon, selecting every \(k\)-th vertex where \(k = n/m\) (and \(m\) is the number of vertices selected), often results in a regular \(m\)-gon, provided \(k\) and \(n\) are chosen such that the selection wraps around evenly. Here, \(n=12\), \(k=2\), and \(m=6\), and since 12 and 2 are compatible (gcd(12,2)=2, but the selection still works symmetrically), we get a regular 6-gon.

Thus, the resulting polygon is a regular hexagon. This makes sense visually: if you imagine a dodecagon and connect every second vertex, you trace out a hexagon that fits perfectly within the same circumcircle, with sides equal to the radius of the circle, a hallmark of a regular hexagon.

**Final Answer**: The resulting polygon is a regular hexagon. This is because deleting every second vertex of a regular dodecagon (12 vertices) leaves 6 equally spaced vertices, and connecting them in order forms a 6-sided polygon with equal side lengths and equal interior angles, which is the definition of a regular hexagon.
