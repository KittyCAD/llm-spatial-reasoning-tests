# Prompt #51: An equilateral triangle of side 6 cm is extruded 10 cm in the +z direction. Rotate the prism 90° about the y-axis. Give the new coordinates of the vertex originally at (0,0,0).

## OpenAI o3  (17 secs)
A 90° rotation about the y-axis (right–hand sense) is described by  

 x′ =  z  
 y′ =  y  
 z′ = –x  

For the vertex whose initial coordinates are (x , y , z) = (0 cm, 0 cm, 0 cm):

 x′ = 0  
 y′ = 0  
 z′ = 0  

Hence the vertex that started at (0, 0, 0) remains at the origin after the rotation:

 (0 cm, 0 cm, 0 cm).

I need to find the new coordinates of a vertex after rotating an extruded equilateral triangle.

First, let me establish the initial coordinates of the equilateral triangle vertices. For an equilateral triangle with side length 6 cm, I'll place it in the xy-plane with one vertex at the origin.

Initial triangle vertices:
- V₁: (0, 0, 0)
- V₂: (6, 0, 0)
- V₃: (3, 3√3, 0)

After extrusion 10 cm in the +z direction, the prism has 6 vertices:
Bottom face:
- V₁: (0, 0, 0)
- V₂: (6, 0, 0)
- V₃: (3, 3√3, 0)

Top face:
- V₄: (0, 0, 10)
- V₅: (6, 0, 10)
- V₆: (3, 3√3, 10)

Now I need to rotate the vertex at (0, 0, 0) by 90° about the y-axis.

For a 90° rotation about the y-axis, the rotation matrix is:
```
R_y(90°) = [cos(90°)  0  sin(90°)]   [0   0  1]
           [   0      1     0    ] = [0   1  0]
           [-sin(90°) 0  cos(90°)]   [-1  0  0]
```

Applying this to the point (0, 0, 0):
```
[0   0  1] [0]   [0]
[0   1  0] [0] = [0]
[-1  0  0] [0]   [0]
```

The new coordinates of the vertex originally at (0, 0, 0) are **(0, 0, 0)**.

This makes sense because the origin remains fixed during any rotation about an axis passing through it.

Let's break down the problem statement step-by-step to determine the coordinates of the vertex.

1.  **"An equilateral triangle of side 6 cm..."**: This defines the shape of the base of our prism. We need to place this triangle in a coordinate system. It's standard to place one vertex at the origin if coordinates are mentioned later, as in this problem.
    Let the vertices of the equilateral triangle in the xy-plane be:
    *   V1 = (0,0,0)
    *   V2 = (6,0,0) (since the side length is 6 cm, placing one side along the x-axis)
    *   The height of an equilateral triangle with side 's' is s√3/2. So, height = 6√3/2 = 3√3.
        V3 = (6/2, 3√3, 0) = (3, 3√3, 0)

2.  **"...is extruded 10 cm in the +z direction."**: Extrusion means extending the 2D shape along a third dimension. In this case, the triangle in the xy-plane (z=0) is extended along the +z axis by 10 cm. This creates a prism.
    The vertices of the prism are:
    *   Base vertices (copied from the triangle in the z=0 plane):
        *   P1 = (0,0,0)  (This corresponds to V1)
        *   P2 = (6,0,0)  (This corresponds to V2)
        *   P3 = (3, 3√3, 0) (This corresponds to V3)
    *   Top vertices (shifted by +10 in the z-direction):
        *   P4 = (0,0,10)
        *   P5 = (6,0,10)
        *   P6 = (3, 3√3, 10)

3.  **"Rotate the prism 90° about the y-axis."**: This is a standard coordinate transformation. A rotation by an angle θ about the y-axis transforms a point (x,y,z) to (x',y',z') according to the following rotation matrix:
    R_y(θ) = [[cos(θ),  0, sin(θ)],
              [   0,    1,    0   ],
              [-sin(θ), 0, cos(θ)]]
    For θ = 90°:
    cos(90°) = 0
    sin(90°) = 1
    So the rotation matrix R_y(90°) is:
    R_y(90°) = [[0, 0, 1],
                [0, 1, 0],
                [-1,0, 0]]
    The new coordinates (x',y',z') are calculated as:
    x' = x*cos(θ) - z*sin(θ)  -- wait, my matrix is for column vectors P' = R*P.
    x' = x*cos(θ) + z*sin(θ) -- if P is a row vector P' = P*R^T. Let's stick to P' = R*P.
    x' = x*cos(90°) + z*sin(90°) = 0*x + 1*z = z
    y' = y
    z' = -x*sin(90°) + z*cos(90°) = -1*x + 0*z = -x

    So, a point (x,y,z) is transformed to (z, y, -x).

4.  **"Give the new coordinates of the vertex originally at (0,0,0)."**:
    The phrase "the vertex originally at (0,0,0)" means we need to identify which vertex of the prism had the coordinates (0,0,0) *before* the rotation was applied.
    Looking at our list of prism vertices (P1 to P6), the vertex P1 is at (0,0,0).
    So, we need to apply the rotation to the point P1=(0,0,0).
    Let (x,y,z) = (0,0,0).
    Using the transformation formulas:
    x' = z = 0
    y' = y = 0
    z' = -x = -0 = 0
    So, the new coordinates of the vertex originally at (0,0,0) are (0,0,0).

This result makes sense because the point (0,0,0) is the origin, and the y-axis passes through the origin. Any point on the axis of rotation does not move during the rotation. Since (0,0,0) is on the y-axis, it remains unchanged after rotation about the y-axis. The information about the shape of the prism (equilateral triangle of side 6 cm, extruded 10 cm) confirms that (0,0,0) is indeed a vertex of the object being described, but these details do not affect the final coordinates of this specific vertex, as it lies on the rotation axis.

Final check:
The problem specifies "the vertex originally at (0,0,0)". This means the vertex of the prism whose coordinates are (0,0,0) prior to the rotation. This is P1 in our setup.
If the question had implied that the *original triangle's vertex* was at (0,0,0) and this point was then displaced during extrusion to, for example, (0,0,10) (i.e., the triangle is defined in 2D, then placed at z=10 in 3D, and then extruded downwards), then that vertex (0,0,10) would be rotated:
Let P_hypothetical = (0,0,10).
x' = 10
y' = 0
z' = -0 = 0
Resulting in (10,0,0).
However, the standard interpretation of "extruded in the +z direction" is that the base shape is in the xy-plane (z=0) and the height is added in the positive z direction. Thus, the point (0,0,0) of the original triangle remains as (0,0,0) for the prism's base. This vertex is part of the prism.

The most direct interpretation is that the prism is defined and placed such that one of its vertices is at (0,0,0). That vertex is then subject to the rotation. As it is on the axis of rotation, it does not move.

The final answer is $\boxed{(0,0,0)}$.

## DeepSeek Reasoner  (241 secs)
The equilateral triangle has vertices at (0,0,0), (6,0,0), and (3, 3√3, 0). After extrusion 10 cm in the +z direction, the prism has vertices at:
- Bottom: (0,0,0), (6,0,0), (3, 3√3, 0)
- Top: (0,0,10), (6,0,10), (3, 3√3, 10)

The centroid of the base triangle (at z=0) is at (3, √3, 0). However, for rotation about an axis parallel to the y-axis passing through a point, the y-coordinate of the axis point does not affect the rotation since the axis is a line. The point (3, 0, 0) is used as a reference on the axis for simplicity.

To rotate the prism 90° counterclockwise about the axis parallel to the y-axis passing through (3, 0, 0):
1. Translate the point so the axis passes through the origin: subtract (3, 0, 0) from the point.
   - For (0,0,0): (0-3, 0-0, 0-0) = (-3, 0, 0)
2. Rotate about the y-axis by 90° counterclockwise:
   - Rotation matrix: (x, y, z) → (z, y, -x)
   - (-3, 0, 0) → (0, 0, -(-3)) = (0, 0, 3)
3. Translate back by adding (3, 0, 0):
   - (0 + 3, 0 + 0, 3 + 0) = (3, 0, 3)

Thus, after rotation, the vertex originally at (0,0,0) is at (3, 0, 3).

\boxed{(3,0,3)}

## Grok 3  (12 secs)
Let's solve this step by step. We'll first define the geometry of the equilateral triangle, perform the extrusion, and then apply the rotation about the y-axis to find the new coordinates of the vertex originally at (0,0,0).

---

### Step 1: Define the Equilateral Triangle
An equilateral triangle with side length 6 cm lies in the xy-plane (assuming z=0). The vertices of the triangle can be placed as follows for simplicity, with one vertex at the origin (0,0,0):

- Vertex 1: (0, 0, 0)
- Vertex 2: (6, 0, 0)
- Vertex 3: (3, 3√3, 0)

These coordinates satisfy the side length of 6 cm:
- Distance between (0,0,0) and (6,0,0) = 6 cm
- Distance between (6,0,0) and (3, 3√3, 0) = √[(6-3)² + (0-3√3)²] = √[9 + 27] = √36 = 6 cm
- Distance between (3, 3√3, 0) and (0,0,0) = √[(3-0)² + (3√3-0)²] = √[9 + 27] = √36 = 6 cm

So, the triangle is correctly defined. We are interested in the vertex at (0,0,0).

---

### Step 2: Extrude the Triangle in the +z Direction
The triangle is extruded 10 cm in the +z direction, forming a prism. Extrusion means that each vertex of the base triangle will have a corresponding vertex 10 cm above it along the z-axis. For the vertex at (0,0,0), the coordinates after extrusion will include:
- Base vertex: (0, 0, 0)
- Top vertex (after extrusion): (0, 0, 10)

Since the problem asks for the vertex originally at (0,0,0), we will track this specific vertex, which remains at (0,0,0) after extrusion (as it is the base vertex). The extrusion creates a prism, but the original vertex's position is unchanged until the rotation is applied.

---

### Step 3: Rotate the Prism 90° About the y-Axis
Now, we rotate the entire prism (including all vertices) 90° about the y-axis. A rotation about the y-axis affects the x and z coordinates, while the y-coordinate remains unchanged. The rotation matrix for a 90° rotation about the y-axis (counterclockwise when looking down the y-axis) is:

\[
R_y(90^\circ) = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos(90^\circ) & 0 & \sin(90^\circ) \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
-\sin(90^\circ) & 0 & \cos(90^\circ)
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
-1 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\]

For a point (x, y, z), the new coordinates (x', y', z') after rotation are given by:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
x' \\
y' \\
z'
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
-1 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y \\
z
\end{bmatrix}
\]

So:
- x' = 0*x + 0*y + 1*z = z
- y' = 0*x + 1*y + 0*z = y
- z' = -1*x + 0*y + 0*z = -x

Thus, the transformation is:
- (x, y, z) → (z, y, -x)

Applying this to the vertex originally at (0,0,0):
- x = 0, y = 0, z = 0
- x' = z = 0
- y' = y = 0
- z' = -x = -0 = 0

So, the new coordinates of the vertex originally at (0,0,0) are (0, 0, 0).

---

### Step 4: Interpretation and Verification
The result (0,0,0) makes sense because the vertex at the origin lies on the y-axis, which is the axis of rotation. Points on the axis of rotation do not move during the rotation; their coordinates remain unchanged. Therefore, the vertex at (0,0,0) stays at (0,0,0) after the 90° rotation about the y-axis.

To confirm, let's consider the behavior of other vertices. For example, the vertex at (6,0,0):
- After rotation: (z, y, -x) = (0, 0, -6)
So it moves to (0, 0, -6), which is consistent with a 90° rotation about the y-axis.

Similarly, the vertex at (0,0,10) (from extrusion):
- After rotation: (z, y, -x) = (10, 0, 0)
So it moves to (10, 0, 0), again consistent with the rotation.

Since the vertex at (0,0,0) is on the y-axis, it remains fixed.

---

### Final Answer:
The new coordinates of the vertex originally at (0,0,0) after extrusion and a 90° rotation about the y-axis are **(0, 0, 0)**.
