I'll work through this step-by-step.

First, let me draw a block letter 'G' on a fixed-width grid:

```
#####
#   #
#    
# ###
#   #
#   #
#####
```

Now, rotating 90° clockwise in-plane:
- Top row becomes rightmost column
- Left column becomes top row
- Bottom row becomes leftmost column
- Right column becomes bottom row

After 90° clockwise rotation:
```
#######
#     #
#     #
# #   #
  #   #
  #####
```

Now reflecting across the vertical mid-line:
- The leftmost column becomes rightmost
- The rightmost column becomes leftmost
- Middle columns swap symmetrically

Final result after reflection:
```
#######
#     #
#     #
#   # #
#   #  
#####  
```

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step.

1.  **Choose a Block Letter 'G' and Grid Size:**
    I'll use a 7x7 grid. For the 'G' itself, I'll design a 5x5 character block, which will be centered within the 7x7 grid (1-pixel padding all around). I'll use '#' for the letter and '.' for the background.

    Initial 'G' (5x5 letter part):
    ```
    #####
    #....
    #.###
    #...#
    #####
    ```
    Placed in the 7x7 grid (let's call this `Grid_Initial`):
    ```
    .......
    .#####.
    .#.....
    .#.###.
    .#...#.
    .#####.
    .......
    ```

2.  **Rotate 90° Clockwise In-Plane:**
    The 7x7 grid itself rotates. A point `(row, col)` in the original grid moves to `(col, GridHeight - 1 - row)`. Here, GridHeight = 7. So, `(row, col)` -> `(col, 6 - row)`.
    Let's consider the 5x5 letter part first. Original letter part `L[r][c]` (0-indexed, 0 to 4). New letter part `L_rot[nr][nc]`. `nr = c`, `nc = (5-1)-r = 4-r`.

    *   `L[0][0..4] = #####` -> `L_rot[0][4]=#`, `L_rot[1][4]=#`, `L_rot[2][4]=#`, `L_rot[3][4]=#`, `L_rot[4][4]=#`
    *   `L[1][0..4] = #....` -> `L_rot[0][3]=#`, `L_rot[1][3]=.`, `L_rot[2][3]=.`, `L_rot[3][3]=.`, `L_rot[4][3]=.`
    *   `L[2][0..4] = #.###` -> `L_rot[0][2]=#`, `L_rot[1][2]=.`, `L_rot[2][2]=#`, `L_rot[3][2]=#`, `L_rot[4][2]=#`
    *   `L[3][0..4] = #...#` -> `L_rot[0][1]=#`, `L_rot[1][1]=.`, `L_rot[2][1]=.`, `L_rot[3][1]=.`, `L_rot[4][1]=#`
    *   `L[4][0..4] = #####` -> `L_rot[0][0]=#`, `L_rot[1][0]=#`, `L_rot[2][0]=#`, `L_rot[3][0]=#`, `L_rot[4][0]=#`

    Reconstructing `L_rot` row by row:
    Row 0: `#####` (from `L_rot[0][0]` to `L_rot[0][4]`)
    Row 1: `#...#` (from `L_rot[1][0]` to `L_rot[1][4]`)
    Row 2: `#.#.#`
    Row 3: `#.#.#`
    Row 4: `###.#`

    So the rotated 5x5 letter part looks like this:
    ```
    #####
    #...#
    #.#.#
    #.#.#
    ###.#
    ```
    This rotated letter part is still 5x5, so it remains centered in the 7x7 grid.
    `Grid_Rotated`:
    ```
    .......
    .#####.
    .#...#.
    .#.#.#.
    .#.#.#.
    .###.#.
    .......
    ```

3.  **Reflect Across the Vertical Mid-line:**
    The 7x7 grid has columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The vertical mid-line is column 3.
    Reflection means a point `(row, col)` moves to `(row, GridWidth - 1 - col)`. Here, GridWidth = 7. So, `(row, col)` -> `(row, 6 - col)`.
    Let `Grid_Final` be the result. `Grid_Final[r][c] = Grid_Rotated[r][6-c]`.

    *   Row 0: `Grid_Rotated[0]` is `.......`. It's symmetric, so `Grid_Final[0]` is `.......`.
    *   Row 1: `Grid_Rotated[1]` is `.#####.`. It's symmetric, so `Grid_Final[1]` is `.#####.`.
    *   Row 2: `Grid_Rotated[2]` is `.#...#.`. It's symmetric, so `Grid_Final[2]` is `.#...#.`.
    *   Row 3: `Grid_Rotated[3]` is `.#.#.#.`. It's symmetric, so `Grid_Final[3]` is `.#.#.#.`.
    *   Row 4: `Grid_Rotated[4]` is `.#.#.#.`. It's symmetric, so `Grid_Final[4]` is `.#.#.#.`.
    *   Row 5: `Grid_Rotated[5]` is `.###.#.`
        `Grid_Final[5][0] = Grid_Rotated[5][6] = .`
        `Grid_Final[5][1] = Grid_Rotated[5][5] = #`
        `Grid_Final[5][2] = Grid_Rotated[5][4] = .`
        `Grid_Final[5][3] = Grid_Rotated[5][3] = #`
        `Grid_Final[5][4] = Grid_Rotated[5][2] = #`
        `Grid_Final[5][5] = Grid_Rotated[5][1] = #`
        `Grid_Final[5][6] = Grid_Rotated[5][0] = .`
        So, `Grid_Final[5]` is `.#.###.`.
    *   Row 6: `Grid_Rotated[6]` is `.......`. It's symmetric, so `Grid_Final[6]` is `.......`.

Final ASCII Drawing:
```
.......
.#####.
.#...#.
.#.#.#.
.#.#.#.
.#.###.
.......
```

After rotating the block letter 'G' 90° clockwise in-plane and then reflecting it across the vertical mid-line, the final ASCII drawing is as follows. The original 'G' was drawn on a 7-row by 5-column grid. After rotation, the grid becomes 5 rows by 7 columns. The reflection step swaps columns symmetrically across the vertical midline (column index 3 in a 0-based 7-column grid).

**Final ASCII Drawing:**

```
 ***** 
*     *
*  *  *
*  *  *
 * *** 
```

### Explanation:
- **Row 0:** Space, five asterisks, space (` ***** `).
- **Row 1:** Asterisk, five spaces, asterisk (`*     *`).
- **Row 2:** Asterisk, two spaces, asterisk, two spaces, asterisk (`*  *  *`).
- **Row 3:** Same as Row 2 (`*  *  *`).
- **Row 4:** Space, asterisk, space, three asterisks, space (` * *** `).

This grid represents the transformed 'G' after the specified operations. The drawing uses spaces (not shown explicitly) and asterisks (`*`) for clarity.

Let's go through this step by step to draw a block letter 'G', rotate it 90° clockwise in-plane, and then reflect it across the vertical mid-line of the grid. I'll use a fixed-width grid (let's say 5x5 for simplicity, as it fits a block 'G' well) and represent the letter with '#' characters and empty spaces with '.'.

### Step 1: Draw the Block Letter 'G'
A block letter 'G' on a 5x5 grid can look like this, with the main structure resembling the shape of a 'G':

```
. # # # .
. # . . .
. # # # .
. . . # .
. # # # .
```

- The top row forms the top bar of the 'G'.
- The left column forms the vertical stroke.
- The bottom rows curve back to form the lower part and the middle horizontal stroke.

### Step 2: Rotate 90° Clockwise In-Plane
Rotating a grid 90° clockwise means each position (i,j) moves to (j, n-1-i), where n is the grid size (5 here). So, let's map each '#' to its new position:

- Original grid (row, col):
  - Row 0: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3) → '#'
  - Row 1: (1,1) → '#'
  - Row 2: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) → '#'
  - Row 3: (3,3) → '#'
  - Row 4: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) → '#'

After 90° clockwise rotation (new_row = old_col, new_col = 4 - old_row):
- (0,1) → (1,4)
- (0,2) → (2,4)
- (0,3) → (3,4)
- (1,1) → (1,3)
- (2,1) → (1,2)
- (2,2) → (2,2)
- (2,3) → (3,2)
- (3,3) → (3,1)
- (4,1) → (1,0)
- (4,2) → (2,0)
- (4,3) → (3,0)

The rotated grid becomes:

```
. . . . .
# . # . #
# . # . #
# . # # #
. . . . .
```

### Step 3: Reflect Across the Vertical Mid-Line
The vertical mid-line of a 5x5 grid is between columns 2 and 3 (since 5/2 = 2.5, so we flip across col=2). Reflection means swapping columns 0 with 4, and 1 with 3. So, for each row:
- Col 0 swaps with Col 4
- Col 1 swaps with Col 3
- Col 2 stays the same

Applying this to the rotated grid:

- Row 0: . . . . . → . . . . .
- Row 1: # . # . # → # . # . #
- Row 2: # . # . # → # . # . #
- Row 3: # . # # # → # # # . #
- Row 4: . . . . . → . . . . .

In a 5x5 grid, reflecting across the vertical mid-line (col=2 as the center):
- Col 0 becomes Col 4
- Col 1 becomes Col 3
- Col 2 stays Col 2
- Col 3 becomes Col 1
- Col 4 becomes Col 0

So, for each row:
- Row 1: # . # . # → # . # . #
  - Pos 0 (#) → Pos 4 (#)
  - Pos 1 (.) → Pos 3 (.)
  - Pos 2 (#) stays (#)
  - Pos 3 (.) → Pos 1 (.)
  - Pos 4 (#) → Pos 0 (#)
  Result: # . # . # (same as original row, coincidentally)
- Row 2: # . # . # → # . # . # (same as above)
- Row 3: # . # # # → # # # . #
  - Pos 0 (#) → Pos 4 (#)
  - Pos 1 (.) → Pos 3 (.)
  - Pos 2 (#) stays (#)
  - Pos 3 (#) → Pos 1 (#)
  - Pos 4 (#) → Pos 0 (#)
  Result: # # # . #

The final grid after reflection is:

```
. . . . .
# . # . #
# . # . #
# # # . #
. . . . .
```

### Final ASCII Drawing
The final result after rotating the block letter 'G' 90° clockwise and reflecting it across the vertical mid-line is:

```
. . . . .
# . # . #
# . # . #
# # # . #
. . . . .
```

This is the final ASCII representation of the transformed 'G'. Note that due to the symmetry in some rows, the reflection didn't alter the appearance drastically in rows 1 and 2, but row 3 shows the effect of the flip. If you visualize it, the original 'G' has been transformed into a new shape that reflects the specified operations.
