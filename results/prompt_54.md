# Prompt #54: Imagine the capital letter 'E' cut from cardboard. Flip it 180° about a **horizontal axis** (toward you like a somersault). ASCII-draw what you see afterward.

## OpenAI o3  (29 secs)
After the half-somersault the shape looks exactly the same as it did before the flip:

```
***** 
*     
***** 
*     
***** 
```

(i.e. still a capital “E”).

Let me think through this step by step.

Starting with a capital 'E':
```
█████
█
█████
█
█████
```

When I flip it 180° about a horizontal axis (like a somersault toward me), the top becomes the bottom and vice versa. The letter also appears reversed left-to-right from my viewing perspective.

After the flip:
```
█████
    █
█████
    █
█████
```

This is essentially a backwards 'E' (like the number '3').

Okay, let's visualize this.

The letter 'E' looks like this:

```
EEEEE
E
EEEEE
E
EEEEE
```

Now, imagine a horizontal line running through the middle arm of the 'E'. When you flip it 180° about this axis (like a somersault towards you), the top arm becomes the bottom arm, the bottom arm becomes the top arm, and the middle arm stays in the middle. The vertical spine also stays on the left.

So, after the flip, it will look exactly the same!

```
EEEEE
E
EEEEE
E
EEEEE
```

The letter 'E' has horizontal symmetry, so flipping it this way doesn't change its appearance.

## DeepSeek Reasoner  (269 secs)
After flipping the capital letter 'E' 180° about a horizontal axis (somersault forward), you are now viewing the backside of the cardboard. This transformation results in two changes:
1. **Vertical flip**: The top becomes the bottom and vice versa.
2. **Mirroring (horizontal flip)**: The left and right are swapped because you are viewing the back.

The original 'E' in ASCII art (5x5 grid) is typically drawn as:
```
#####
#    
#####
#    
#####
```
- Top bar: `#####` (row 1)
- Vertical bar on the left: `#` in rows 2 and 4
- Middle bar: `#####` (row 3)
- Bottom bar: `#####` (row 5)

After the flip:
- **Vertical flip**: Rows are reversed. The original bottom bar (row 5) becomes the top bar, and the original top bar (row 1) becomes the bottom bar.
- **Mirroring**: Each row is reversed horizontally. The vertical bar, originally on the left, now appears on the right.

Applying both transformations:
- Original row 5 (`#####`) → becomes row 1, reversed horizontally = `#####` (unchanged, symmetric).
- Original row 4 (`#    `) → becomes row 2, reversed = `    #`.
- Original row 3 (`#####`) → becomes row 3, reversed = `#####`.
- Original row 2 (`#    `) → becomes row 4, reversed = `    #`.
- Original row 1 (`#####`) → becomes row 5, reversed = `#####`.

Resulting ASCII art:
```
#####
    #
#####
    #
#####
```
- The horizontal bars remain full width (`#####`).
- The vertical bar is now on the right (appears in rows 2 and 4 as `    #`).

Thus, the flipped 'E' appears as:
```
#####
    #
#####
    #
#####
```

Let's visualize this step by step. The capital letter 'E' typically looks like this in a simple ASCII representation:

```
***
*  
*  
***
*  
*  
***
```

This represents the letter 'E' with three horizontal bars and a vertical stem on the left.

Now, we are instructed to flip it 180° about a **horizontal axis**, described as "toward you like a somersault." A horizontal axis means the axis of rotation is horizontal, running left to right through the middle of the 'E'. A 180° flip about this axis (like a somersault toward you) means the top of the 'E' moves down and the bottom moves up, effectively turning it upside down.

After flipping the 'E' 180° about the horizontal axis, the structure will be inverted vertically. The top bar becomes the bottom, the middle bar stays in the middle, and the bottom bar becomes the top, with the vertical stem still on the left. So, the ASCII representation of the flipped 'E' would look like this:

```
***
*  
*  
***
*  
*  
***
```

Wait, that looks the same as the original! This is because the letter 'E' has a structure that, when flipped 180° about a horizontal axis, still resembles an 'E' in this basic ASCII form due to its symmetry in the horizontal bars. However, let me double-check the interpretation of the flip.

If we consider a more detailed view, flipping 180° about a horizontal axis (like a somersault toward you) means each point on the 'E' moves to the opposite side of the horizontal midline. For a capital 'E', the top bar moves to the bottom, the bottom bar to the top, and the middle bar stays roughly in place. In a strict geometric sense, this inversion should still look like an 'E' because the bars are evenly spaced in most fonts.

However, if the 'E' were asymmetric or if we consider the "somersault toward you" to imply a perspective or a different axis, we might be misinterpreting. Let me reconsider the phrase "toward you like a somersault." It likely emphasizes that it's a front-to-back motion over a horizontal axis, but in 2D, this is still just a vertical inversion.

Alternatively, perhaps there's confusion with the axis. If "horizontal axis" is misinterpreted, or if the flip is meant to be about a vertical axis (mirroring left to right), it would look different. But the problem specifies a horizontal axis, so vertical inversion is correct.

In ASCII, since the 'E' is blocky and symmetric in this representation, the flipped version still looks like:

```
***
*  
*  
***
*  
*  
***
```

But I suspect the intent might be to recognize that in a real cardboard cutout, flipping it 180° over a horizontal axis (somersault) might imply a front-to-back consideration. However, since it's a 2D drawing, and cardboard is flat, we stick to the 2D plane.

Upon further reflection, I think I may have overthought this. In a 2D plane, flipping 180° about a horizontal axis is just turning it upside down, and for 'E', it still looks like 'E' in basic form. But if we imagine a physical cardboard 'E', flipping it "toward you" might mean rotating it in 3D space, but the problem likely intends a 2D flip.

Looking at standard geometry, a 180° rotation about a horizontal axis in 2D is equivalent to reflecting over the horizontal line. For 'E', this still visually resembles 'E'.

I think the correct ASCII after a 180° flip about a horizontal axis (upside down) is still:

```
***
*  
*  
***
*  
*  
***
```

But let me try to be precise. If I label the rows from 1 to 7 in the original:

Row 1: ***
Row 2: *  
Row 3: *  
Row 4: ***
Row 5: *  
Row 6: *  
Row 7: ***

After flipping 180° about a horizontal axis (reflecting over the middle row, Row 4), Row 1 swaps with Row 7, Row 2 with Row 6, Row 3 with Row 5, and Row 4 stays the same:

Row 1: *** (was Row 7)
Row 2: *   (was Row 6)
Row 3: *   (was Row 5)
Row 4: ***
Row 5: *   (was Row 3)
Row 6: *   (was Row 2)
Row 7: *** (was Row 1)

So it's:

```
***
*  
*  
***
*  
*  
***
```

Indeed, it looks the same as the original 'E'. I think this is correct because 'E' has a form that, when inverted vertically, still appears as 'E' in this simple representation.

However, I recall that in some contexts, especially with physical objects, flipping "toward you" might imply a different visual, but since it's ASCII and 2D, I believe this is the intended result.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intends a 180° rotation in the plane (not about an axis but around a point), which would also invert it similarly, or perhaps a different axis. A 180° rotation around the center point of the 'E' in 2D would turn it upside down and also reverse left to right, making it look like a backward 'E', but the problem specifies "about a horizontal axis," which is a flip, not a rotation in the plane.

In 2D, "flip about a horizontal axis" means reflection over a horizontal line, which is what I did. In 3D, flipping a cardboard 'E' 180° about a horizontal axis through its center would mean the top edge comes toward you and down to the bottom, but since it's flat cardboard, the face that was toward you might now be away, but in ASCII, we can't show depth.

I think I should stick with the 2D interpretation. The problem might expect the 'E' to look the same after flipping due to its symmetry in this form.

Let me check one more thing: if the 'E' is not symmetric, or if the bars are uneven, flipping would be noticeable, but in standard 'E', it's often symmetric enough.

I believe my initial drawing is correct. So the final ASCII drawing after flipping 180° about a horizontal axis is:

```
***
*  
*  
***
*  
*  
***
```

This represents the letter 'E' flipped upside down, which, in this simple form, looks identical to the original.

**Final Answer**
