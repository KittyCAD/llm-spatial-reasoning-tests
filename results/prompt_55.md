# Prompt #55: ASCII box: corners (0,0),(5,0),(5,3),(0,3). First apply the shear x' = x + 0.5·y, then rotate the shape 90° counter-clockwise. Sketch the final outline in ASCII.

## OpenAI o3  (48 secs)
After the two transformations the rectangle has become a parallelogram whose integer-grid vertices are  

(0,13) – (6,10) – (6,0) – (0,3)

(the figure has been shifted 3 units to the right so every x-coordinate is non–negative, which makes it easier to draw in ASCII).  
Using ‘|’ for vertical edges, ‘/’ and ‘\’ for the two slanted edges and ‘+’ for the four corners, the outline looks like this:

```
+      
| /    
|   /  
|     +
|     |
|     |
|     |

|     |

    \ |
      +
```

Read each line left-to-right; the first line is the top of the picture, the last line is the bottom.

I'll work through this step by step.

Starting with a rectangle with corners at (0,0), (5,0), (5,3), (0,3).

**Step 1: Apply shear transformation x' = x + 0.5·y**

For each corner:
- (0,0): x' = 0 + 0.5·0 = 0, so (0,0)
- (5,0): x' = 5 + 0.5·0 = 5, so (5,0)
- (5,3): x' = 5 + 0.5·3 = 6.5, so (6.5,3)
- (0,3): x' = 0 + 0.5·3 = 1.5, so (1.5,3)

After shear: parallelogram with corners (0,0), (5,0), (6.5,3), (1.5,3)

**Step 2: Rotate 90° counter-clockwise**

Rotation formula: (x,y) → (-y,x)
- (0,0) → (0,0)
- (5,0) → (0,5)
- (6.5,3) → (-3,6.5)
- (1.5,3) → (-3,1.5)

**Final shape corners:** (0,0), (0,5), (-3,6.5), (-3,1.5)

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step.

**1. Initial Box Coordinates:**
A = (0,0)
B = (5,0)
C = (5,3)
D = (0,3)

**2. Apply Shear Transformation:**
The shear transformation is given by:
x' = x + 0.5 * y
y' = y

Let's apply this to each corner:
*   **A(0,0):**
    x' = 0 + 0.5 * 0 = 0
    y' = 0
    A' = (0,0)
*   **B(5,0):**
    x' = 5 + 0.5 * 0 = 5
    y' = 0
    B' = (5,0)
*   **C(5,3):**
    x' = 5 + 0.5 * 3 = 5 + 1.5 = 6.5
    y' = 3
    C' = (6.5,3)
*   **D(0,3):**
    x' = 0 + 0.5 * 3 = 1.5
    y' = 3
    D' = (1.5,3)

So, after shearing, the coordinates are:
A' = (0,0)
B' = (5,0)
C' = (6.5,3)
D' = (1.5,3)
This shape is a parallelogram.

**3. Apply 90° Counter-Clockwise Rotation:**
The rotation transformation for 90° counter-clockwise about the origin is:
x_new = -y_old
y_new = x_old

Let's apply this to the sheared coordinates (A', B', C', D'):
*   **A'(0,0):**
    x_new = -0 = 0
    y_new = 0
    A'' = (0,0)
*   **B'(5,0):**
    x_new = -0 = 0
    y_new = 5
    B'' = (0,5)
*   **C'(6.5,3):**
    x_new = -3
    y_new = 6.5
    C'' = (-3, 6.5)
*   **D'(1.5,3):**
    x_new = -3
    y_new = 1.5
    D'' = (-3, 1.5)

The final coordinates are:
A'' = (0,0)
B'' = (0,5)
C'' = (-3, 6.5)
D'' = (-3, 1.5)

**4. Sketching the Final Outline in ASCII:**
Let's analyze the final shape:
*   Line A''B'' goes from (0,0) to (0,5). This is a vertical line segment along the y-axis.
*   Line D''C'' goes from (-3,1.5) to (-3,6.5). This is a vertical line segment parallel to the y-axis, at x=-3.
*   Line A''D'' goes from (0,0) to (-3,1.5). This is a slanted line.
*   Line B''C'' goes from (0,5) to (-3,6.5). This is a slanted line, parallel to A''D''.

The shape is a parallelogram.
*   x-coordinates range from -3 to 0.
*   y-coordinates range from 0 to 6.5.

To draw this in ASCII, we can establish a grid. Let's use a scale where:
*   Each character column represents 1 unit in x.
*   Each character row represents 0.5 units in y (to accurately place y=1.5 and y=6.5).

X-axis range: -3, -2, -1, 0 (4 columns)
Y-axis range: 0 to 6.5 (this means 6.5 / 0.5 = 13 units + 1 for y=0, so 14 rows)

Let the leftmost column be x=-3 and the rightmost x=0.
Let the top row represent y=6.5 and the bottom row y=0.

Coordinates in our ASCII grid (col, row_from_top):
*   C''(-3, 6.5): col 0, row 0
*   B''(0, 5):   col 3, row (6.5-5)/0.5 = 3
*   D''(-3, 1.5): col 0, row (6.5-1.5)/0.5 = 10
*   A''(0,0):    col 3, row (6.5-0)/0.5 = 13

Let's draw:
Point C'' is at (col 0, row 0).
Point B'' is at (col 3, row 3).
Point D'' is at (col 0, row 10).
Point A'' is at (col 3, row 13).

Line C''D'' is vertical from (0,0) to (0,10) in grid.
Line B''A'' is vertical from (3,3) to (3,13) in grid.
Line C''B'' slants from (0,0) to (3,3) in grid. For every 1 step right, 1 step down. Use `\`.
Line D''A'' slants from (0,10) to (3,13) in grid. For every 1 step right, 1 step down. Use `\`.

Here's the sketch:

```ascii
+---+  (C'')
|\ \ |
| \ \
|  \+  (B'')
|  ||
|  ||
|  ||
|  ||
|  ||
|  ||
+--+|  (D'')
 \ ||
  \||
   \+  (A'')
```
Let's refine this. The points C'' and D'' are at x=-3. B'' and A'' are at x=0.
The character `+` marks corners. `|` for vertical lines, `\` for these diagonals.

Grid mapping:
`char grid[14][4];` (14 rows, 4 columns)
`grid[row_from_top][col_from_left]`

C''(-3, 6.5) -> `grid[0][0] = '+'`
B''(0, 5.0)  -> `grid[3][3] = '+'` (row index for y=5.0 is (6.5-5.0)/0.5 = 3)
D''(-3, 1.5) -> `grid[10][0] = '+'` (row index for y=1.5 is (6.5-1.5)/0.5 = 10)
A''(0, 0.0)  -> `grid[13][3] = '+'` (row index for y=0.0 is (6.5-0.0)/0.5 = 13)

Vertical line C''D'': `grid[r][0] = '|'` for r = 1 to 9.
Vertical line B''A'': `grid[r][3] = '|'` for r = 4 to 12.
Diagonal C''B'': `grid[1][1] = '\'`, `grid[2][2] = '\'`
Diagonal D''A'': `grid[11][1] = '\'`, `grid[12][2] = '\'`

This yields:
```ascii
+---    (Row 0: C'' at grid[0][0])
| \--   (Row 1: | at grid[1][0], \ at grid[1][1])
|  \--  (Row 2: | at grid[2][0], \ at grid[2][2])
|   +   (Row 3: | at grid[3][0], + at grid[3][3] for B'')
|   |
|   |
|   |
|   |
|   |
|   |
+   |   (Row 10: + at grid[10][0] for D'', | at grid[10][3])
 \  |   (Row 11: \ at grid[11][1], | at grid[11][3])
  \ |   (Row 12: \ at grid[12][2], | at grid[12][3])
   \+   (Row 13: + at grid[13][3] for A'')
```
The previous ASCII representation was slightly messy. Here is the cleaned up version based on the grid logic:

```ascii
+       (C'' at x=-3, y=6.5)
| \
|  \
|   +   (B'' at x=0, y=5.0)
|   |
|   |
|   |
|   |
|   |
|   |
+   |   (D'' at x=-3, y=1.5)
 \  |
  \ |
   \+   (A'' at x=0, y=0.0)
```
The characters represent:
- `+` corner points
- `|` vertical lines
- `\` diagonal lines (connecting C'' to B'', and D'' to A'')
- Spaces are empty areas.

Let's double check the position of characters. Each character occupies a cell.
Col 0: x=-3
Col 1: x=-2
Col 2: x=-1
Col 3: x=0

Row 0: y=6.5
Row 1: y=6.0
Row 2: y=5.5
Row 3: y=5.0 (B'')
Row 4: y=4.5
Row 5: y=4.0
Row 6: y=3.5
Row 7: y=3.0
Row 8: y=2.5
Row 9: y=2.0
Row 10: y=1.5 (D'')
Row 11: y=1.0
Row 12: y=0.5
Row 13: y=0.0 (A'')

Final ASCII sketch:
```
+··     (C'')
| \·
| ·\
| ··+   (B'')
| ··|
| ··|
| ··|
| ··|
| ··|
| ··|
+·· |   (D'')
·\· |
··\|
···+   (A'')
```
(Using `·` for spaces to show alignment, final output will use actual spaces)

```ascii

```

## DeepSeek Reasoner  (492 secs)
The original rectangle has corners at (0,0), (5,0), (5,3), and (0,3). After applying the shear transformation \(x' = x + 0.5 \cdot y\), the new coordinates are:
- (0,0) → (0,0)
- (5,0) → (5,0)
- (5,3) → (5 + 0.5·3, 3) = (6.5, 3)
- (0,3) → (0 + 0.5·3, 3) = (1.5, 3)

Next, a 90° counter-clockwise rotation is applied, which maps \((x, y)\) to \((-y, x)\). The rotated points are:
- (0,0) → (0,0)
- (5,0) → (0,5)
- (6.5,3) → (-3,6.5)
- (1.5,3) → (-3,1.5)

To facilitate ASCII sketching, the coordinates are scaled by 2 to eliminate decimals, resulting in integer points:
- (0,0) → (0,0)
- (0,5) → (0,10)
- (-3,6.5) → (-6,13)
- (-3,1.5) → (-6,3)

The outline is drawn on a grid with x from -6 to 0 (7 columns) and y from 0 to 13 (14 rows). The y-axis is inverted for ASCII display (row 0 is top, y=13; row 13 is bottom, y=0). The columns are indexed from 0 (x=-6) to 6 (x=0).

The final outline consists of the following points:
- Vertical side at x=0 (scaled): (0,0) to (0,10) → Column k=6, rows j=13 (y=0) to j=3 (y=10)
- Vertical side at x=-6 (scaled): (-6,3) to (-6,13) → Column k=0, rows j=10 (y=3) to j=0 (y=13)
- Diagonal side from (0,10) to (-6,13): Points at integer coordinates (0,10), (-2,11), (-4,12), (-6,13) → (k=6,j=3), (k=4,j=2), (k=2,j=1), (k=0,j=0)
- Diagonal side from (-6,3) to (0,0): Points at integer coordinates (-6,3), (-4,2), (-2,1), (0,0) → (k=0,j=10), (k=2,j=11), (k=4,j=12), (k=6,j=13)

The ASCII grid is 14 rows by 7 columns. Each cell is marked with '#' if part of the outline, else space. The grid is printed row by row from top (j=0, y=13) to bottom (j=13, y=0).

Final ASCII sketch:
```
#      
# #    
#   #  
#     #
#     #
#     #
#     #
#     #
#     #
#     #
#     #
  #   #
    # #
      #
```

Explanation of the sketch:
- Row 0 (y=13): Only (x=-6, y=13) → '#' at column 0.
- Row 1 (y=12): (x=-6, y=12) and (x=-4, y=12) → '#' at columns 0 and 2.
- Row 2 (y=11): (x=-6, y=11) and (x=-2, y=11) → '#' at columns 0 and 4.
- Rows 3 to 10 (y=10 to y=3): (x=-6, y) and (x=0, y) → '#' at columns 0 and 6.
- Row 11 (y=2): (x=-4, y=2) and (x=0, y=2) → '#' at columns 2 and 6.
- Row 12 (y=1): (x=-2, y=1) and (x=0, y=1) → '#' at columns 4 and 6.
- Row 13 (y=0): Only (x=0, y=0) → '#' at column 6.

This represents a parallelogram after the transformations.

## Grok 3  (13 secs)
Let's solve this step by step. We'll transform the given ASCII box with corners at (0,0), (5,0), (5,3), and (0,3) by applying a shear transformation followed by a 90° counter-clockwise rotation, and then sketch the final outline in ASCII.

### Step 1: Original Points
The original box has the following coordinates:
- Bottom-left: (0, 0)
- Bottom-right: (5, 0)
- Top-right: (5, 3)
- Top-left: (0, 3)

This forms a rectangle with width 5 and height 3.

### Step 2: Apply Shear Transformation
The shear transformation is given by:
- x' = x + 0.5·y
- y' = y

Applying this to each corner:
- (0, 0): x' = 0 + 0.5·0 = 0, y' = 0 → (0, 0)
- (5, 0): x' = 5 + 0.5·0 = 5, y' = 0 → (5, 0)
- (5, 3): x' = 5 + 0.5·3 = 5 + 1.5 = 6.5, y' = 3 → (6.5, 3)
- (0, 3): x' = 0 + 0.5·3 = 1.5, y' = 3 → (1.5, 3)

After shear, the points are:
- (0, 0)
- (5, 0)
- (6.5, 3)
- (1.5, 3)

This transforms the rectangle into a parallelogram, where the top edge is shifted to the right by 1.5 units.

### Step 3: Apply 90° Counter-Clockwise Rotation
A 90° counter-clockwise rotation transforms coordinates as:
- x' = -y
- y' = x

Applying this to the sheared points:
- (0, 0): x' = -0 = 0, y' = 0 → (0, 0)
- (5, 0): x' = -0 = 0, y' = 5 → (0, 5)
- (6.5, 3): x' = -3 = -3, y' = 6.5 → (-3, 6.5)
- (1.5, 3): x' = -3 = -3, y' = 1.5 → (-3, 1.5)

So, the transformed points after rotation are:
- (0, 0)
- (0, 5)
- (-3, 6.5)
- (-3, 1.5)

### Step 4: Determine the Bounding Box for ASCII Sketch
To sketch this in ASCII, we need to determine the range of x and y values:
- x-range: from -3 to 0
- y-range: from 0 to 6.5 (we'll round 6.5 to 7 for simplicity in a discrete grid)

The shape is now a parallelogram with vertices at the above points. Since ASCII art is limited to a grid, we'll approximate the positions and draw the outline.

### Step 5: Sketch the Final Outline in ASCII
We'll create a grid with x from -3 to 1 and y from 0 to 7. We'll use a simple character grid to represent the outline. Due to the discrete nature of ASCII, the points (-3, 6.5) and (-3, 1.5) will be approximated to the nearest integers for plotting.

Approximated points for plotting:
- (0, 0)
- (0, 5)
- (-3, 7) [rounding 6.5 up for visibility]
- (-3, 2) [rounding 1.5 up for visibility]

Now, let's draw the outline by connecting these points:
- From (0, 0) to (0, 5): vertical line at x=0
- From (0, 5) to (-3, 7): diagonal line
- From (-3, 7) to (-3, 2): vertical line at x=-3
- From (-3, 2) to (0, 0): diagonal line

Here's the ASCII sketch (flipped vertically because in text, y increases downward):

```
y=7    |     *
y=6    |     *
y=5    *    *
y=4    *   *
y=3    *  *
y=2    * *
y=1    **
y=0    *
       -3  -2  -1   0   x
```

### Explanation of the Sketch
- The vertical line from (0, 0) to (0, 5) is represented by '*' at x=0 for y=0 to y=5.
- The vertical line from (-3, 2) to (-3, 7) is represented by '*' at x=-3 for y=2 to y=7.
- The diagonal from (0, 5) to (-3, 7) is approximated by stepping down x and up y.
- The diagonal from (-3, 2) to (0, 0) is approximated similarly.

Given the limitations of ASCII art, this is a rough approximation. The '*' characters trace the approximate outline of the transformed parallelogram. If a more precise grid or tool were available, the lines would be smoother, but this captures the general shape and orientation after the transformations.

### Final Answer
The final outline of the shape after applying the shear and 90° counter-clockwise rotation is sketched in ASCII as shown above. The shape is a parallelogram with vertices approximately at (0,0), (0,5), (-3,7), and (-3,2).
