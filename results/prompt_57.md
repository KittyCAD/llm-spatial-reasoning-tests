I need to work through this step-by-step.

Starting with the L-tetromino footprint:
- (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1)

Extruding 3 layers deep toward +z gives me a 3D solid occupying:
- (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (2,0,0), (2,1,0)
- (0,0,1), (1,0,1), (2,0,1), (2,1,1)
- (0,0,2), (1,0,2), (2,0,2), (2,1,2)

Now rotating 90° about the y-axis. The rotation transformation is:
- x' = -z
- y' = y
- z' = x

Applying this to each point:
- (0,0,0) → (0,0,0)
- (1,0,0) → (0,0,1)
- (2,0,0) → (0,0,2)
- (2,1,0) → (0,1,2)
- (0,0,1) → (-1,0,0)
- (1,0,1) → (-1,0,1)
- (2,0,1) → (-1,0,2)
- (2,1,1) → (-1,1,2)
- (0,0,2) → (-2,0,0)
- (1,0,2) → (-2,0,1)
- (2,0,2) → (-2,0,2)
- (2,1,2) → (-2,1,2)

To display this, I'll shift all x-coordinates by +2 to make them non-negative:

Layer z=0: points at (2,0), (1,0), (0,0), (0,1)
Layer z=1: points at (2,0), (1,0), (0,0), (0,1)
Layer z=2: points at (2,0), (1,0), (0,0), (0,1), (2,1)

z=0:
```

```

z=1:
```

X

```

z=2:
```
XX

```

Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1.  **Initial L-tetromino footprint:**
    The points are (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1).
    In the xy-plane (implicitly z=0):
    ```
    y
    ^
    1 | . . #  (2,1)
    0 | # # #  (0,0), (1,0), (2,0)
      +-------> x
        0 1 2
    ```

2.  **Extrude 3 layers deep toward +z:**
    This means the footprint is copied for z=0, z=1, and z=2.
    The 3D solid consists of these 4 * 3 = 12 points (voxels):
    *   z=0: (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (2,0,0), (2,1,0)
    *   z=1: (0,0,1), (1,0,1), (2,0,1), (2,1,1)
    *   z=2: (0,0,2), (1,0,2), (2,0,2), (2,1,2)

3.  **Rotate 90° about the y-axis:**
    A standard rotation of a point (x,y,z) by an angle θ about the y-axis transforms it to (x',y',z') where:
    x' = x*cos(θ) + z*sin(θ)
    y' = y
    z' = -x*sin(θ) + z*cos(θ)

    For θ = 90° (or π/2 radians):
    cos(90°) = 0
    sin(90°) = 1
    So the transformation becomes:
    x' = z
    y' = y
    z' = -x

    Let's apply this to all 12 points of our solid.
    Let (x_orig, y_orig, z_orig) be the original coordinates and (x_rot, y_rot, z_rot) be the rotated coordinates.
    (x_rot, y_rot, z_rot) = (z_orig, y_orig, -x_orig)

    Points from original z_orig=0 layer:
    *   (0,0,0) -> (0,0,0)
    *   (1,0,0) -> (0,0,-1)
    *   (2,0,0) -> (0,0,-2)
    *   (2,1,0) -> (0,1,-2)

    Points from original z_orig=1 layer:
    *   (0,0,1) -> (1,0,0)
    *   (1,0,1) -> (1,0,-1)
    *   (2,0,1) -> (1,0,-2)
    *   (2,1,1) -> (1,1,-2)

    Points from original z_orig=2 layer:
    *   (0,0,2) -> (2,0,0)
    *   (1,0,2) -> (2,0,-1)
    *   (2,0,2) -> (2,0,-2)
    *   (2,1,2) -> (2,1,-2)

    These are the 12 points of the rotated solid. Their coordinates are (x_rot, y_rot, z_rot).

4.  **Prepare ASCII layers for specified z values:**
    The problem asks for layers at z=0, z=1, z=2 of the *rotated* solid.
    Our current z_rot coordinates are 0, -1, -2. To map these to the requested 0, 1, 2 layers, we need to shift them.
    The minimum z_rot is -2. We'll define z_final = z_rot - (-2) = z_rot + 2.
    So,
    *   Requested z=0 corresponds to z_rot = -2.
    *   Requested z=1 corresponds to z_rot = -1.
    *   Requested z=2 corresponds to z_rot = 0.

    The maximum x_rot is 2 (from z_orig=2) and maximum y_rot is 1.
    So, each layer will be a grid with x from 0 to 2 and y from 0 to 1. We'll use '#' for solid and '.' for empty.

    **Layer z_final = 0 (where z_rot = -2):**
    These are points where the original x_orig was 2.
    (x_rot, y_rot, z_rot):
    *   (0,0,-2)  (from original (2,0,0))
    *   (0,1,-2)  (from original (2,1,0))
    *   (1,0,-2)  (from original (2,0,1))
    *   (1,1,-2)  (from original (2,1,1))
    *   (2,0,-2)  (from original (2,0,2))
    *   (2,1,-2)  (from original (2,1,2))
    In (x_rot, y_rot) coordinates for this z_final=0 layer:
    (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1)
    ASCII (y increasing downwards, x increasing to the right):
    For y_rot=0: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0)  -> ###
    For y_rot=1: (0,1), (1,1), (2,1)  -> ###

    **Layer z_final = 1 (where z_rot = -1):**
    These are points where the original x_orig was 1.
    (x_rot, y_rot, z_rot):
    *   (0,0,-1)  (from original (1,0,0))
    *   (1,0,-1)  (from original (1,0,1))
    *   (2,0,-1)  (from original (1,0,2))
    (Note: original points (1,1,z_orig) were not part of the L-tetromino.)
    In (x_rot, y_rot) coordinates for this z_final=1 layer:
    (0,0), (1,0), (2,0)
    ASCII:
    For y_rot=0: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0)  -> ###
    For y_rot=1: (empty)             -> ...

    **Layer z_final = 2 (where z_rot = 0):**
    These are points where the original x_orig was 0.
    (x_rot, y_rot, z_rot):
    *   (0,0,0)   (from original (0,0,0))
    *   (1,0,0)   (from original (0,0,1))
    *   (2,0,0)   (from original (0,0,2))
    (Note: original points (0,1,z_orig) were not part of the L-tetromino.)
    In (x_rot, y_rot) coordinates for this z_final=2 layer:
    (0,0), (1,0), (2,0)
    ASCII:
    For y_rot=0: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0)  -> ###
    For y_rot=1: (empty)             -> ...

5.  **Final ASCII Output:**

    Layer z=0:
    ```
    ###
    ###
    ```

    Layer z=1:
    ```
    ###
    ...
    ```

    Layer z=2:
    ```
    ###
    ...
    ```

## DeepSeek Reasoner  (419 secs)
After extruding the L-tetromino footprint ((0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1)) 3 layers deep in the +z direction, the 3D solid is rotated 90° counterclockwise about the y-axis. The rotation transforms the coordinates as follows: for a point (x, y, z) in the original solid, the new coordinates (x', y', z') after rotation and shifting to non-negative indices are:

- x' = z
- y' = y
- z' = 2 - x

The layers of the rotated solid at z' = 0, 1, and 2 are provided below in ASCII format. Each layer is represented as a grid with x' ranging from 0 to 2 (columns) and y' from 0 to 1 (rows), where '#' indicates a filled cell and '.' an empty cell. For each layer, the row with y' = 1 (top) is printed first, followed by y' = 0 (bottom).

- **Layer z' = 0**:  
  All cells filled because the original points with x=2 (at any z) map to this layer.  
  y'=1: ### (x'=0,1,2 filled)  
  y'=0: ### (x'=0,1,2 filled)  
  Output:  
  `###`  
  `###`

- **Layer z' = 1**:  
  Only the bottom row (y'=0) is filled, corresponding to original points with x=1 (at any z, y=0).  
  y'=1: ... (no points)  
  y'=0: ### (x'=0,1,2 filled)  
  Output:  
  `...`  
  `###`

- **Layer z' = 2**:  
  Only the bottom row (y'=0) is filled, corresponding to original points with x=0 (at any z, y=0).  
  y'=1: ... (no points)  
  y'=0: ### (x'=0,1,2 filled)

## Grok 3  (23 secs)
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the L-tetromino footprint
The L-tetromino footprint is given as the set of 2D coordinates in the xy-plane:
- (0,0)
- (1,0)
- (2,0)
- (2,1)

This forms a shape that looks like this in the xy-plane (z=0):
```
y
^
|
1 |  X
0 |X X X
  +------
    0 1 2  x
```

Where "X" represents the occupied cells.

### Step 2: Extrude the footprint 3 layers deep toward +z
Extruding the 2D footprint along the +z direction for 3 layers means replicating the same 2D pattern at z=0, z=1, and z=2. So, the 3D solid before rotation has the following occupied cells:
- At z=0: (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (2,0,0), (2,1,0)
- At z=1: (0,0,1), (1,0,1), (2,0,1), (2,1,1)
- At z=2: (0,0,2), (1,0,2), (2,0,2), (2,1,2)

This forms a 3D solid that extends the L-tetromino shape upward along the z-axis.

### Step 3: Rotate the 3D solid 90° about the y-axis
A 90° rotation about the y-axis transforms the coordinates (x, y, z) to (z, y, -x). Let's apply this transformation to each point in the solid.

Original points (before rotation):
- (0,0,0) → (0,0,0)
- (1,0,0) → (0,0,-1)
- (2,0,0) → (0,0,-2)
- (2,1,0) → (0,1,-2)
- (0,0,1) → (1,0,0)
- (1,0,1) → (1,0,-1)
- (2,0,1) → (1,0,-2)
- (2,1,1) → (1,1,-2)
- (0,0,2) → (2,0,0)
- (1,0,2) → (2,0,-1)
- (2,0,2) → (2,0,-2)
- (2,1,2) → (2,1,-2)

After rotation, the points are:
- (0,0,0)
- (0,0,-1)
- (0,0,-2)
- (0,1,-2)
- (1,0,0)
- (1,0,-1)
- (1,0,-2)
- (1,1,-2)
- (2,0,0)
- (2,0,-1)
- (2,0,-2)
- (2,1,-2)

### Step 4: Organize the points by z-level after rotation
Now, let's group the points by their new z-coordinate (which is -x from the original coordinates):
- z=0: Points where z=0 after rotation (original x=0)
  - (0,0,0)
  - (1,0,0)
  - (2,0,0)
- z=-1: Points where z=-1 after rotation (original x=1)
  - (0,0,-1)
  - (1,0,-1)
  - (2,0,-1)
- z=-2: Points where z=-2 after rotation (original x=2)
  - (0,0,-2)
  - (1,0,-2)
  - (2,0,-2)
  - (0,1,-2)
  - (1,1,-2)
  - (2,1,-2)

Since the problem asks for ASCII layers at z=0,1,2, and the rotated solid has z-values at 0, -1, and -2, it seems there might be a mismatch in the expected z-range. However, interpreting the problem's intent, I'll assume we provide the layers for the z-values present in the rotated solid. If z=0,1,2 refers to a shifted coordinate system, I’ll note that the rotated z-values are negative, so I’ll map them as z=0 (for z=0), z=1 (for z=-1), and z=2 (for z=-2) for display purposes, or simply provide the layers as they are.

To align with the problem statement requesting z=0,1,2, I’ll assume a possible typo or shift in context, but for clarity, I’ll provide the layers for z=0, z=-1, and z=-2 as they are after rotation.

### Step 5: Create ASCII layers for z=0, z=-1, z=-2
Now, plot the (x,y) coordinates for each z-layer after rotation. Note that after rotation, x corresponds to the original z, and y remains y.

- **Layer z=0** (points with z=0):
  - (0,0,0) → x=0, y=0
  - (1,0,0) → x=1, y=0
  - (2,0,0) → x=2, y=0
  ```
  y
  ^
  1 |  
  0 |X X X
    +------
      0 1 2  x
  ```

- **Layer z=-1** (points with z=-1):
  - (0,0,-1) → x=0, y=0
  - (1,0,-1) → x=1, y=0
  - (2,0,-1) → x=2, y=0
  ```
  y
  ^
  1 |  
  0 |X X X
    +------
      0 1 2  x
  ```

- **Layer z=-2** (points with z=-2):
  - (0,0,-2) → x=0, y=0
  - (1,0,-2) → x=1, y=0
  - (2,0,-2) → x=2, y=0
  - (0,1,-2) → x=0, y=1
  - (1,1,-2) → x=1, y=1
  - (2,1,-2) → x=2, y=1
  ```
  y
  ^
  1 |X X X
  0 |X X X
    +------
      0 1 2  x
  ```

### Step 6: Adjust for z=0,1,2 interpretation
Since the problem asks for z=0,1,2, and my calculation shows z=0,-1,-2, I’ll assume the intent is to display the layers of the rotated solid. If z=0,1,2 refers to the new x or another axis, I note the discrepancy. However, since after rotation x corresponds to the original z, and the extrusion was along z (now x after rotation), the layers above make sense.

To match the problem's request for "z=0,1,2", I’ll relabel the layers by shifting the z-coordinate or assume the problem meant the layers along the new z-axis. Since z after rotation is derived from -x, and to provide a positive z range, I’ll present z=0 as the first layer, z=1 as the second, etc., though I note the actual z values are 0, -1, -2.

### Final ASCII Layers (labeled as z=0,1,2 for problem context)
I’ll provide the layers as z=0 (for z=0), z=1 (for z=-1), z=2 (for z=-2):

- **z=0**:
  ```
  y
  ^
  1 |  
  0 |X X X
    +------
      0 1 2  x
  ```

- **z=1**:
  ```
  y
  ^
  1 |  
  0 |X X X
    +------
      0 1 2  x
  ```

- **z=2**:
  ```
  y
  ^
  1 |X X X
  0 |X X X
    +------
      0 1 2  x
  ```

This interpretation assumes the problem's z=0,1,2 refers to a relabeling of the layers post-rotation. If a different rotation or axis is implied, please clarify. For now, these are the layers of the rotated solid as computed.
