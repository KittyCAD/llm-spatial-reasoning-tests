# Prompt #60: ASCII spiral: '@' at (0,0), '#' at (1,0), '$' at (1,1), '%' at (0,1). Unwind the spiral by rotating those four points 90° CCW about the square’s center. Output the new 2×2 grid.

I need to rotate the 2×2 grid 90° counterclockwise about its center.

Initial grid:
```
% $
@ #
```

The center of a 2×2 grid is at (0.5, 0.5).

For a 90° CCW rotation about the center:
- (0,0) → (1,0)
- (1,0) → (1,1)
- (1,1) → (0,1)
- (0,1) → (0,0)

So:
- '@' at (0,0) moves to (1,0)
- '#' at (1,0) moves to (1,1)
- '$' at (1,1) moves to (0,1)
- '%' at (0,1) moves to (0,0)

New grid:
```
$ #
% @
```

Okay, let's break this down.

**1. Initial Grid & Coordinates:**

We can represent the initial grid and the coordinates (x,y) of each character, assuming (0,0) is the top-left:

*   `@` at (0,0)
*   `#` at (1,0)
*   `%` at (0,1)
*   `$` at (1,1)

Visually:
```
@ #
% $
```

**2. Center of Rotation:**

The square is defined by the points (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), and (1,1).
The center of this square is at x = (0+1)/2 = 0.5, and y = (0+1)/2 = 0.5.
So, the center of rotation P is (0.5, 0.5).

**3. 90° CCW Rotation Formula:**

To rotate a point (x,y) 90° CCW around a point (px,py) to get (x',y'):
x' = px - (y - py)
y' = py + (x - px)

In our case, (px,py) = (0.5, 0.5):
x' = 0.5 - (y - 0.5) = 0.5 - y + 0.5 = 1 - y
y' = 0.5 + (x - 0.5) = 0.5 + x - 0.5 = x

So, the new point (x', y') is (1-y, x).

**4. Apply Rotation to Each Point:**

*   **@ (0,0):**
    x' = 1 - 0 = 1
    y' = 0
    New position for '@': (1,0)

*   **# (1,0):**
    x' = 1 - 0 = 1
    y' = 1
    New position for '#': (1,1)

*   **$ (1,1):**
    x' = 1 - 1 = 0
    y' = 1
    New position for '$': (0,1)

*   **% (0,1):**
    x' = 1 - 1 = 0
    y' = 0
    New position for '%': (0,0)

**5. Construct the New Grid:**

Mapping the characters to their new (x,y) coordinates:
*   (0,0) is now occupied by '%'
*   (1,0) is now occupied by '@'
*   (0,1) is now occupied by '$'
*   (1,1) is now occupied by '#'

So the new 2x2 grid is:

```
% @
$ #
```

The task involves rotating the given 2×2 grid of characters 90 degrees counter-clockwise (CCW) about the center of the square. The original positions are:

- '@' at (0,0)
- '#' at (1,0)
- '$' at (1,1)
- '%' at (0,1)

The center of the square is at (0.5, 0.5). To rotate a point (x, y) 90° CCW around (0.5, 0.5), use the transformation:
- New x = 1 - y
- New y = x

Apply this transformation to each point:

- '@' at (0,0):  
  New position: (1 - 0, 0) = (1, 0)  
  So, '@' moves to (1,0)

- '#' at (1,0):  
  New position: (1 - 0, 1) = (1, 1)  
  So, '#' moves to (1,1)

- '$' at (1,1):  
  New position: (1 - 1, 1) = (0, 1)  
  So, '$' moves to (0,1)

- '%' at (0,1):  
  New position: (1 - 1, 0) = (0, 0)  
  So, '%' moves to (0,0)

After rotation, the new grid assignments are:
- (0,0): '%'
- (1,0): '@'
- (0,1): '$'
- (1,1): '#'

Output the grid row by row, with the top row first (y=0) and the bottom row second (y=1):
- Top row (y=0): (0,0) and (1,0) → "%@"
- Bottom row (y=1): (0,1) and (1,1) → "$#"

Thus, the new 2×2 grid is:

```
%@
$#
```

Let's solve this step by step.

1. First, we identify the initial positions of the symbols in the 2×2 grid:
   - '@' at (0,0) — top-left
   - '#' at (1,0) — top-right
   - '$' at (1,1) — bottom-right
   - '%' at (0,1) — bottom-left

   This forms the initial grid:
   ```
   @ #
   % $
   ```

2. Next, we need to rotate these points 90° counterclockwise (CCW) around the center of the 2×2 grid. The center of a 2×2 grid, with coordinates from (0,0) to (1,1), is at (0.5, 0.5).

3. To rotate a point (x, y) 90° CCW around a center (cx, cy), we use the transformation:
   - New x = cx - (y - cy)
   - New y = cy + (x - cx)

   Applying this to each point with cx = 0.5 and cy = 0.5:
   - For '@' at (0,0):
     - New x = 0.5 - (0 - 0.5) = 0.5 - (-0.5) = 1
     - New y = 0.5 + (0 - 0.5) = 0.5 - 0.5 = 0
     - New position: (1,0)
   - For '#' at (1,0):
     - New x = 0.5 - (0 - 0.5) = 0.5 - (-0.5) = 1
     - New y = 0.5 + (1 - 0.5) = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1
     - New position: (1,1)
   - For '$' at (1,1):
     - New x = 0.5 - (1 - 0.5) = 0.5 - 0.5 = 0
     - New y = 0.5 + (1 - 0.5) = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1
     - New position: (0,1)
   - For '%' at (0,1):
     - New x = 0.5 - (1 - 0.5) = 0.5 - 0.5 = 0
     - New y = 0.5 + (0 - 0.5) = 0.5 - 0.5 = 0
     - New position: (0,0)

4. Now, we place the symbols in their new positions:
   - (0,0): '%'
   - (1,0): '@'
   - (0,1): '$'
   - (1,1): '#'

   This forms the new grid:
   ```
   % @
   $ #
   ```

**Output:**
```
% @
$ #
```
